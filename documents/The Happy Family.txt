Pink gathered that much from the crew,\r\nbesides observing much for himself. Hence what follows after.', 'Sherwood Branciforte was down in the blacksmith shop at the Rocking\r\nR, watching one Andy Green hammer a spur-shank straight. Andy was what\r\nhe himself called a tamer of wild ones, and he was hard upon his\r\nriding gear. Sherwood had that morning watched with much admiration\r\nthe bending of that same spur-shank, and his respect for Andy was\r\nbeautiful to behold.', '"Lord, but this is a big, wild country," he was saying\r\nenthusiastically, "and the people in it are big and—"', '"Wild," supplied Andy. "Yes, you\'ve just about got us sized up\r\ncorrect." He went on hammering, and humming under his breath, and\r\nthinking that, while admiration is all right in its time and place, it\r\nis sometimes a bit wearisome.', '"Oh, but I didn\'t mean that," the young man protested. "What I meant\r\nwas breezy and picturesque. Things can happen, out here. Life and men\r\ndon\'t run in grooves."', '"No, nor horses," assented Andy. "Leastways, not in oiled ones." He\r\nwas remembering how that spur-shank had become bent.', '"You did some magnificent riding, this morning. By Jove! I\'ve never\r\nseen anything like it. Strange that one can come out here into a part\r\nof the country absolutely new and raw, and see things—"', '"Oh, it ain\'t so raw as you might think," Andy defended jealously,\r\n"nor yet new."', '"Of course it is new! A commonwealth in the making. You can\'t," he\r\nasserted triumphantly, "point to anything man-made that existed a\r\nhundred years ago; scarcely fifty, either. Your civilization is yet in\r\nthe cradle—a lusty infant, and a—er—vociferous one, but still an\r\ninfant in swaddling clothes." Sherwood Branciforte had given lectures\r\nbefore the Y.M.C.A. of his home town, and young ladies had spoken of\r\nhim as "gifted," and he had come to hear of it, and to believe.', 'Andy Green squinted at the shank before he made reply. Andy, also, was\r\n"gifted," in his modest Western way.', '"A country that can now and then show the papers for a civilization\r\nold as the Phenixes of Egypt," he said, in a drawling tone that was\r\nabsolutely convincing, "ain\'t what I\'d call raw." He decided that a\r\nlittle more hammering right next the rowel was necessary, and bent\r\nover the anvil solicitously. Even the self-complacency of Sherwood\r\nBranciforte could not fail to note his utter indifference to the\r\npresence and opinions of his companion. Branciforte was accustomed to\r\ndisputation at times—even to enmity; but not to indifference. He\r\nblinked. "My dear fellow, do you realize what it is that statement\r\nmight seem to imply?" he queried haughtily.', 'Andy, being a cowpuncher of the brand known as a "real," objected\r\nstrongly both to the term and the tone. He stood up and stared down at\r\nthe other disapprovingly. "I don\'t as a general thing find myself\r\nguilty of talking in my sleep," he retorted, "and I\'m prepared to let\r\nanything I say stand till the next throw. We may be some vociferous,\r\nout here twixt the Mississippi and the Rockies, but we ain\'t no\r\ninfant-in-the-cradle, Mister. We had civilization here when the\r\nPilgrim Fathers\' rock wasn\'t nothing but a pebble to let fly at the\r\nbirds!"', '"Indeed!" fleered Sherwood Branciforte, in a voice which gave much\r\nintangible insult to one\'s intelligence.', 'Andy clicked his teeth together, which was a symptom it were well for\r\nthe other to recognize but did not. Then Andy smiled, which was\r\nanother symptom. He fingered the spur absently, laid it down and\r\nreached, with the gesture that betrays the act as having become second\r\nnature, for his papers and tobacco sack.', '"Uh course, you mean all right, and you ain\'t none to blame for what\r\nyou don\'t know, but you\'re talking wild and scattering. When you stand\r\nup and tell me I can\'t point to nothing man-made that\'s fifty years\r\nold, or a hundred, you make me feel sorry for yuh. I can take you to\r\nsomething—or I\'ve seen something—that\'s older than swearing; and I\r\nreckon that art goes back to when men wore their hair long and a\r\nsheep-pelt was called ample for dress occasions."', '"Are you crazy, man?" Sherwood Branciforte exclaimed incredulously.', '"Not what you can notice. You wait whilst I explain. Once last fall I\r\nwas riding by my high lonesome away down next the river, when my horse\r\nwent lame on me from slipping on a shale bank, and I was set afoot. Uh\r\ncourse, you being plumb ignorant of our picturesque life, you don\'t\r\nhalf know all that might signify to imply." This last in open\r\nimitation of Branciforte. "It implies that I was in one hell of a fix,\r\nto put it elegant. I was sixty miles from anywhere, and them sixty\r\nhalf the time standing on end and lapping over on themselves. That\r\nthere is down where old mama Nature gave full swing to a morbid\r\nhankering after doing things unconventional. Result is, that it\'s\r\nabout as ungodly a mixture of nightmare scenery as this old world can\r\nshow up; and I\'ve ambled around considerable and am in a position to\r\npass judgment.', '"So there I was, and I wasn\'t in no mood to view the beauties uh\r\nnature to speak of; for instance, I didn\'t admire the clouds sailing\r\naround promiscous in the sky, nor anything like that. I was high and\r\ndry and the walking was about as poor as I ever seen; and my boots was\r\nhigh-heel and rubbed blisters before I\'d covered a mile of that\r\nacrobatic territory. I wanted water, and I wanted it bad. Before I got\r\nit I wanted it a heap worse." He stopped, cupped his slim fingers\r\naround a match-blaze, and Branciforte sat closer. He did not know what\r\nwas coming, but the manner of the indifferent narrator was compelling.\r\nHe almost forgot the point at issue in the adventure.', '"Along about dark, I camped for the night under a big, bare-faced\r\ncliff that was about as homelike and inviting as a charitable\r\ninstitution, and made a bluff at sleeping and cussed my bum luck in a\r\nway that wasn\'t any bluff. At sun-up I rose and mooched on." His\r\ncigarette needed another match and he searched his pockets for one.', '"What about the—whatever it was you started to tell me?" urged\r\nBranciforte, grown impatient.', 'Andy looked him over calmly. "You\'ve lived in ignorance for about\r\nthirty years or so—giving a rough guess at your age; I reckon you can\r\nstand another five minutes. As I was saying, I wandered around like a\r\ndogy when it\'s first turned loose on the range and is trying to find\r\nthe old, familiar barn-yard and the skim-milk bucket. And like the\r\ndogy, I didn\'t run across anything that looked natural or inviting.\r\nAll that day I perambulated over them hills, and I will say I wasn\'t\r\nenjoying the stroll none. You\'re right when you say things can happen,\r\nout here. There\'s some things it\'s just as well they don\'t happen too\r\nfrequent, and getting lost and afoot in the Bad-lands is one.', '"That afternoon I dragged myself up to the edge of a deep coulee and\r\nlooked over to see if there was any way of getting down. There was a\r\nbright green streak down there that couldn\'t mean nothing but water,\r\nat that time of year; this was last fall. And over beyond, I could see\r\nthe river that I\'d went and lost. I looked and looked, but the walls\r\nlooked straight as a Boston\'s man\'s pedigree. And then the sun come\r\nout from behind a cloud and lit up a spot that made me forget for a\r\nminute that I was thirsty as a dog and near starved besides.', '"I was looking down on the ruins—and yet it was near perfect—of an\r\nold castle. Every stone stood out that clear and distinct I could have\r\ncounted \'em. There was a tower at one end, partly fell to pieces but\r\nyet enough left to easy tell what it was. I could see it had kinda\r\nloop-holes in it. There was an open place where I took it the main\r\nentrance had used to be; what I\'d call the official entrance. But\r\nthere was other entrances besides, and some of \'em was made by time\r\nand hard weather. There was what looked like a\r\nwhat-you-may-call-\'em—a ditch thing, yuh mind, running around my side\r\nof it, and a bridge business. Uh course, it was all needing repairs\r\nbad, and part of it yuh needed to use your imagination on. I laid\r\nthere for quite a spell looking it over and wondering how the dickens\r\nit come to be way down there. It didn\'t look to me like it ought to be\r\nthere at all, but in a school geography or a history where the chapter\r\nis on historic and prehistoric hangouts uh the heathen."', '"The deuce! A castle in the Bad-lands!" ejaculated Branciforte.', '"That\'s what it was, all right. I found a trail it would make a\r\nmountain sheep seasick to follow, and I got down into the coulee. It\r\nwas lonesome as sin, and spooky; but there was a spring close by, and\r\na creek running from it; and what is a treat in that part uh the\r\ncountry, it was good drinking and didn\'t have neither alkali nor\r\nsulphur nor mineral in it. It was just straight water, and you can\r\ngamble I filled up on it a-plenty. Then I shot a rabbit or two that\r\nwas hanging out around the ruins, and camped there till next day, when\r\nI found a pass out, and got my bearings by the river and come on into\r\ncamp. So when you throw slurs on our plumb newness and shininess, I\'ve\r\ngot the cards to call yuh. That castle wasn\'t built last summer,\r\nMister. And whoever did build it was some civilized. So there yuh\r\nare."', "Andy took a last, lingering pull at the cigarette stub, flung it into\r\nthe backened forge, and picked up the spur. He settled his hat on his\r\nhead at its accustomed don't-give-a-darn tilt, and started for the\r\ndoor and the sunlight.", '"Oh, but say! didn\'t you find out anything about it afterwards? There\r\nmust have been something—"', '"If it\'s relics uh the dim and musty past yuh mean, there was; relics\r\nto burn. I kicked up specimens of ancient dishes, and truck like that,\r\nwhile I was prowling around for fire-wood. And inside the castle, in\r\nwhat I reckon was used for the main hall, I run acrost a skeleton.\r\nThat is, part of one. I don\'t believe it was all there, though."', '"But, man alive, why haven\'t you made use of a discovery like that?"\r\nBranciforte followed him out, lighting his pipe with fingers that\r\ntrembled. "Don\'t you realize what a thing like that means?"', 'Andy turned and smiled lazily down at him. "At the time I was there, I\r\nwas all took up with the idea uh getting home. I couldn\'t eat\r\nskeletons, Mister, nor yet the remains uh prehistoric dishes. And I\r\ndidn\'t run acrost no money, nor no plan marked up with crosses where\r\nyou\'re supposed to do your excavating for treasure. It wasn\'t\r\nnothing, that I could see, for a man to starve to death while he\r\nexamined it thorough. And so far as I know there ain\'t any record of\r\nit. I never heard no one mention building it, anyhow." He stooped and\r\nadjusted the spur to his heel to see if it were quite right, and went\r\noff to the stable humming under his breath.', 'Branciforte stood at the door of the blacksmith shop and gazed after\r\nhim, puffing meditatively at his pipe. "Lord! the ignorance of these\r\nWestern folk! To run upon a find like that, and to think it less\r\nimportant than getting home in time for supper. To let a discovery\r\nlike that lie forgotten, a mere incident in a day\'s travel! That\r\nfellow thinks more, right now, about his horse going lame and himself\r\nraising blisters on his heels, than of—Jove, what ignorance! He—he\r\ncouldn\'t eat the skeleton or the dishes! Jerusalem!" Branciforte\r\nknocked his pipe gently against the door-casing, put in into his coat\r\npocket and hurried to the house to hunt up the others and tell them\r\nwhat he had heard.', 'That night the roundup pulled in to the home ranch.', 'The visitors, headed by their host, swooped down upon the roundup\r\nwagons just when the boys were gathered together for a cigarette or\r\ntwo apiece and a little talk before rolling in. There was no\r\nnight-guarding to do, and trouble winged afar. Sherwood Branciforte\r\nhunted out Andy Green where he lay at ease with head and shoulders\r\npropped against a wheel of the bed-wagon and gossipped with Pink and a\r\nfew others.', '"Look here, Green," he said in a voice to arrest the attention of the\r\nwhole camp, "I wish you\'d tell the others that tale you told me this\r\nafternoon—about that ruined castle down in the hills. Mason, here, is\r\na newspaper man; he scents a story for his paper. And the rest refuse\r\nto believe a word I say."', '"I\'d hate to have a rep like that, Mr. Branciforte," Andy said\r\ncommiseratingly, and turned his big, honest gray eyes to where stood\r\nthe women—two breezy young persons with sleeves rolled to tanned\r\nelbows and cowboy hats of the musical comedy brand. Also they had gay\r\nsilk handkerchiefs knotted picturesquely around their throats. There\r\nwas another, a giggly, gurgly lady with gray hair fluffed up into a\r\npompadour. You know the sort. She was the kind who refuses to grow\r\nold, and so merely grows imbecile.', '"Do tell us, Mr. Green," this young old lady urged, displaying much\r\ngold by her smile. "It sounds so romantic."', '"It\'s funny you never mentioned it to any of us," put in the "old man"\r\nsuspiciously.', 'Andy pulled himself up into a more decorous position, and turned his\r\neyes towards his boss. "I never knew yuh took any interest in\r\nrelic-hunting," he explained mildly.', '"Sherwood says you found a skeleton!" said the young old lady,\r\nshuddering pleasurably.', '"Yes, I did find one—or part of one," Andy admitted reluctantly.', '"What were the relics of pottery like?" demanded one of the\r\ncowboy-hatted girls, as if she meant to test him. "I do some\r\ncollecting of that sort of thing."', 'Andy threw away his cigarette, and with it all compunction. "Well, I\r\nwasn\'t so much interested in the dishes as in getting something to\r\neat," he apologized. "I saw several different kinds. One was a big,\r\nawkward looking thing and was pretty heavy, and had straight sides.\r\nThen I come across one or two more that was ornamented some. One had\r\nwhat looked like a fish on it, and the other I couldn\'t make out very\r\nwell. They didn\'t look to be worth much, none of \'em."', '"Green," said his employer steadily, "was there such a place?"', 'Andy returned his look honestly. "There was, and there is yet, I\r\nguess," he asserted. "I\'ll tell you how you can find it and what it\'s\r\nlike—if yuh doubt my words." He glanced around and found every man,\r\nincluding the cook, listening intently. He picked a blade of new grass\r\nand began splitting it into tiny threads. The host found boxes for the\r\nwomen to sit upon, and the men sat down upon the grass.', '"Before I come here to work, I was riding for the Circle C. One day I\r\nwas riding away down in the Bad-lands alone and my horse slipped in\r\nsome shale rock and went lame; strained his shoulder so I couldn\'t\r\nride him. That put me afoot, and climbing up and down them hills I\r\nlost my bearings and didn\'t know where I was at for a day or two. I\r\nwandered around aimless, and got into a strip uh country that was new\r\nto me and plumb lonesome and wild. "That second day is when I\r\nhappened across this ruin. I was looking down into a deep, shut-in\r\ncoulee, hunting water, when the sun come out and shone straight on to\r\nthis place. It was right down under me; a stone ruin, with a tower on\r\none end and kinda tumbled down so it wasn\'t so awful high—the tower\r\nwasn\'t. There was a—a—"', '"Moat," Branciforte suggested.', '"That\'s the word—a moat around it, and a bridge that was just about\r\ngone to pieces. It had loopholes, like the pictures of castles, and\r\na—"', '"Battlement?" ventured one of the musical-comedy cowgirls.', 'Andy had not meant to say battlement; of a truth, his conception of\r\nbattlements was extremely hazy, but he caught up the word and warmed\r\nto the subject. "Battlement? well I should guess yes! There was about\r\nas elegant a battlement as I\'d want to see anywhere. It was sure a\r\npeach. It was—" he hesitated for a fraction of a second. "It was high\r\nas the tower, and it had figures carved all over it; them kind that\r\nlooks like kid-drawing in school, with bows and arrows stuck out in\r\nfront of \'em, threatening."', '"Not the old Greek!" exclaimed one of the girls in a little,\r\nbreathless voice.', '"I couldn\'t say as to that," Andy made guarded reply. "I never made no\r\nspecial study of them things. But they was sure old. And—"', '"About how large was the castle?" put in the man who wrote things.\r\n"How many rooms, say?"', '"I\'d hate to give a guess at the size. I didn\'t step it off, and I\'m a\r\npunk guesser. The rooms I didn\'t count. I only explored around in the\r\nmain hall, like, a little. But it got dark early, down in there, and I\r\ndidn\'t have no matches to waste. And next morning I started right out\r\nat sun-up to find the way home. No, I never counted the rooms, and if\r\nI had, the chances are I\'d have likely counted the same one more\'n\r\nonce; to count them rooms would take an expert, which I ain\'t—not at\r\ncounting. I don\'t reckon, though, that there was so awful many.\r\nAnyway, not more than fifteen or twenty. But as I say, I couldn\'t\r\nrightly make a guess, even; or I\'d hate to. Ruins don\'t interest me\r\nmuch, though I was kinda surprised to run acrost that one, all right,\r\nand I\'m willing to gamble there was warm and exciting times down there\r\nwhen the place was in running order. I\'d kinda like to have been down\r\nthere then. Last fall, though, there wasn\'t nothing to get excited\r\nover, except getting out uh there."', '"A castle away out here! Just think, good people, what that means!\r\nRomance, adventure and scientific discoveries! We must go right down\r\nthere and explore the place. Why can\'t we start at once—in the\r\nmorning? This gentleman can guide us to the place, and—"', '"It ain\'t easy going," Andy remarked, conscientiously. "It\'s pretty\r\nrough; some places, you\'d have to walk and lead your horses."', 'They swept aside the discouragement.', '"We\'d need pick and shovels, and men to dig," cried one enthusiast.\r\n"Uncle Peter can lend us some of his men. There may be treasure to\r\nunearth. There may be anything that is wonderful and mysterious. Get\r\nbusy, Uncle Peter, and get your outfit together; you\'ve boasted that a\r\nroundup can beat the army in getting under way quickly, now let us\r\nhave a practical demonstration. We want to start by six o\'clock—all\r\nof us, with a cook and four or five men to do the excavating. Bring it\r\nto pass!" It was the voice of the girl whom her friends spoke of as\r\n"The life of the party;" the voice of the-girl-who-does-things.', '"It\'s sixty-five miles from here, good and strong—and mostly up and\r\ndown," put in Andy.', '"\'Quoth the raven,\'" mocked the-girl-who-does-things. "We are prepared\r\nto face the ups-and-downs. Do we start at six, Uncle Peter?"', 'Uncle Peter glanced sideways at the roundup boss. To bring it to pass,\r\nhe would be obliged to impress the roundup cook and part of the crew.\r\nIt was breaking an unwritten law of the rangeland, and worse, it was\r\ndoing something unbusiness-like and foolish. But not even the owner of\r\nthe Rocking R may withstand the pleading of a pretty woman. Uncle\r\nPeter squirmed, but he promised:', '"We start at six; earlier if you say so."', 'The roundup boss gave his employer a look of disgust and walked away;\r\nthe crew took it that he went off to some secluded place to swear.', 'Thereafter there was much discussion of ways and means, and much\r\nenthusiasm among the visitors from the East—equalled by the\r\ndepression of the crew, for cowboys do not, as a rule, take kindly to\r\npick and shovel, and the excavators had not yet been chosen from\r\namong them. They were uneasy, and they stole frequent, betraying\r\nglances at one another. All of which amused Pink much. Pink would like\r\nto have gone along, and would certainly have offered his services, but\r\nfor the fact that his work there was done and he would have to start\r\nback to the Flying U just as soon as one of his best saddle horses,\r\nwhich had stepped on a broken beer bottle and cut its foot, was able\r\nto travel. That would be in a few days, probably. So Pink sighed and\r\nwatched the preparations enviously.', 'Since he was fairly committed into breaking all precedents, uncle\r\nPeter plunged recklessly. He ordered the mess-wagon to be restocked\r\nand prepared for the trip, and he took the bed-tent and half the crew.\r\nThe foreman he wisely left behind with the remnant of his outfit. They\r\nwere all to eat at the house while the mess-wagon was away, and they\r\nwere to spread their soogans—which is to say beds—where they might,\r\nif the bunk-house proved too small or too hot.', 'The foreman, outraged beyond words, saddled at daybreak and rode to\r\nthe nearest town, and the unchosen half turned out in a body to watch\r\nthe departure of the explorers, which speaks eloquently of their\r\ninterest; for cowboys off duty are prone to sleep long.', 'Andy, as guide, bolted ahead of the party that he might open the gate.\r\nBolted is a good word, for his horse swerved and kept on running,\r\nswerved again, and came down in a heap. Andy did not get up, and the\r\nwomen screamed. Then Pink and some others hurried out and bore Andy,\r\ngroaning, to the bunk-house.', 'The visitors from the East gathered, perturbed, around the door,\r\nsympathetic and dismayed. It looked very much as if their exploration\r\nmust end where it began, and the-girl-who-does-things looked about to\r\nweep, until Andy, still groaning, sent Pink out to comfort them.', '"He says you needn\'t give up the trip on his account," Pink announced\r\nmusically from the doorway. "He\'s drawing a map and marking the coulee\r\nwhere the ruin is. He says most any of the boys that know the country\r\nat all can find the place for yuh. And he isn\'t hurt permanent; he\r\nstrained his back so he can\'t ride, is all." Pink dimpled at the young\r\nold lady who was admiring him frankly, and withdrew.', 'Inside, Andy Green was making pencil marks and giving the chosen half\r\nexplicit directions. At last he folded the paper and handed it to one\r\ncalled Sandy.', '"That\'s the best I can do for yuh," he finished. "I don\'t see how yuh\r\ncan miss it if yuh follow that map close. And if them gay females make\r\nany kick on the trail, you just remind \'em that I said all along it\r\nwas rough going. So long, and good luck."', 'So with high-keyed, feminine laughter and much dust, passed the\r\nexploring party from the Rocking R.', '"Say," Pink began two days later to Andy, who was sitting on the shady\r\nside of the bunk-house staring absently at the skyline, "There\'s a\r\nword uh praise I\'ve been aiming to give yuh. I\'ve seen riding, and\r\nI\'ve done a trifle in that line myself, and learned some uh the\r\ntricks. But I want to say I never did see a man flop his horse any\r\nneater than you done that morning. I\'ll bet there ain\'t another man in\r\nthe outfit got next your play. I couldn\'t uh done it better myself.\r\nWhere did you learn that? Ever ride in Wyoming?"', 'Andy turned his eyes, but not his head—which was a way he had—and\r\nregarded Pink slantwise for at least ten seconds. "Yes, I\'ve rode in\r\nWyoming," he answered quietly. Then: "What\'s the chance for a job, up\r\nyour way? Is the Flying U open for good men and true?"', '"It won\'t cost yuh a cent to try," Pink told him. "How\'s your back?\r\nThink you\'ll be able to ride by the time Skeeker is able to travel?"', 'Andy, grinned. "Say," he confided suddenly, "if that hoss don\'t\r\nimprove some speedy, I\'ll be riding on ahead. I reckon I\'ll be able to\r\ntravel before them explorers get back, my friend."', '"Why?" dimpled Pink boldly.', '"Why? Well, the going is some rough, down that way. If they get them\r\nwagons half way to the coulee marked with a cross, they\'ll sure have\r\nto attach wings onto \'em. I\'ve been some worried about that. I don\'t\r\nmuch believe uncle Peter is going to enjoy that trip—and he sure does\r\nget irritable by spells. I\'ve got a notion to ride for some other\r\noutfit, this summer."', '"Was that the reason you throwed your horse down and got hurt, that\r\nmorning?" questioned Pink, and Andy grinned again by way of reply.', '"They\'ll be gone a week, best they can do," he estimated aloud. "We\r\nought to be able to make our getaway by then, easy."', 'Pink assured him that a week would see them headed for the Flying U.', 'It was the evening of the sixth day, and the two were packed and ready\r\nto leave in the morning, when Andy broke off humming and gave a snort\r\nof dismay. "By gracious, there they come. My mother lives in Buffalo,\r\nPink, in a little drab house with white trimmings. Write and tell her\r\nhow her son— Oh, beloved! but they\'re hitting her up lively. If they\r\nmade the whole trip in that there frame uh mind, they could uh gone\r\nclean to Miles City and back. How pretty the birds sing! Pink, you\'ll\r\nhear words, directly."', 'Directly Pink did.', '"You\'re the biggest liar on earth," Sherwood Branciforte contributed\r\nto the recriminating wave that near engulfed Andy Green. "You sent us\r\ndown there on a wild-goose chase, you brute. You—"', '"I never sent nobody," Andy defended. "You was all crazy to go."', '"And nothing but an old stone hut some trapper had built!" came an\r\nindignant, female tone. "There never was any castle, nor—"', '"A man\'s home is his castle," argued Andy, standing unabashed before\r\nthem. "Putting it that way, it was a castle, all right."', 'There was babel, out of which—', '"And the skeleton! Oh, you—it was a dead cow!" This from the young\r\nold lady, who was looking very draggled and not at all young.', '"I don\'t call to mind ever saying it was human," put in Andy, looking\r\nat her with surprised, gray eyes.', '"And the battlements!" groaned the-girl-who-does-things.', '"You wanted battlements," Andy flung mildly into the uproar. "I always\r\naim to please." With that he edged away from them and made his escape\r\nto where the cook was profanely mixing biscuits for supper. All-day\r\nmoves put an edge to his temper. The cook growled an epithet, and Andy\r\npassed on. Down near the stable he met one of the chosen half, and the\r\nfellow greeted him with a grin. Andy stopped abruptly.', '"Say, they don\'t seem none too agreeable," he began tentatively,\r\njerking his thumb toward the buzzing group. "How about it, Sandy? Was\r\nthey that petulant all the way?"', 'Sandy, the map-bearer, chuckled. "It\'s lucky you got hurt at the last\r\nminute! And yet it was worth the trip. Uh course we got stalled with\r\nthe wagons, the second day out, but them women was sure ambitious, and\r\nmade us go on with a packadero layout. I will say that, going down,\r\nthey stood the hardships remarkable. It was coming back that frazzled\r\nthe party.', '"And when we found the place—say, but it was lucky you wasn\'t along!\r\nThey sure went hog-wild when they seen the ruins. The old party with\r\nthe pompadoor displayed temper, and shed tears uh rage. When she\r\nlooked into the cabin and seen the remains uh that cow-critter, there\r\nwas language it wasn\'t polite to overhear. She said a lot uh things\r\nabout you, Andy. One thing they couldn\'t seem to get over, and that\r\nwas the smallness uh the blamed shack. Them fourteen or fifteen rooms\r\nlaid heavy on their minds."', '"I didn\'t say there was fourteen or fifteen rooms. I said I didn\'t\r\ncount the rooms; I didn\'t either. I never heard of anybody counting\r\none room. Did you, Pink?"', '"No," Pink agreed, "I never did!"', 'Sandy became suddenly convulsed. "Oh, but the funniest thing was the\r\nancient pottery," he gasped, the tears standing in his eyes. "That old\r\nDutch oven was bad enough; but when one uh the girls—that one that\r\ncollects old dishes—happened across an old mackerel can and picked it\r\nup and saw the fish on the label, she was the maddest female person I\r\never saw in my life, barring none. If you\'d been in reach about that\r\ntime, she\'d just about clawed your eyes out, Andy Green. Oh me, oh\r\nmy!" Sandy slapped his thigh and had another spasm.', "Sounds indicated that the wave of recrimination was rolling nearer.\r\nAndy turned to find himself within arm's length of Uncle Pete.", '"Maybe this is your idea of a practical joke, Green," he said to Andy.\r\n"But anyway, it will cost you your job. I ought to charge you up with\r\nthe time my outfit has spent gallivanting around the country on the\r\nstrength of your wild yarn. The quicker you hit the trail, the better\r\nit will suit me. By the way, what\'s your first name?" He asked,\r\npulling out a check-book.', '"Andy," answered the unrepentant one.', '"Andy," Uncle Peter paused with a fountain pen between his fingers. He\r\nlooked Andy up and down, and the frown left his face. He proceeded to\r\nwrite out the check, and when it was done he handed it over with a\r\npleased smile.', '"What did you do it for, Green?" he queried in a friendlier tone.', '"Self-defence," Andy told him laconically, and turned away.', "Half an hour later, Andy and Pink trailed out of the coulee that\r\nsheltered the Rocking R. When they were out and away from the fence,\r\nand Pink's horses, knowing instinctively that they were homeward\r\nbound, were jogging straight west without need of guidance, Andy felt\r\nin his pocket for cigarette material. His fingers came in contact with\r\nthe check Uncle Peter had given him, and he drew it forth and looked\r\nit over again.", '"Well, by gracious!" he said to himself. "Uncle Peter thinks we\'re\r\neven, I guess."', 'He handed the check to Pink and rolled his cigarette; and Pink, after\r\none comprehending look at the slip of paper, doubled up over his\r\nsaddle-horn and shouted with glee—for the check was written: "Pay to\r\nthe order of Ananias Green."', '"And I\'ve got to sign myself a liar, or I don\'t collect no money,"\r\nsighed Andy. "That\'s what I call tough luck, by gracious!"', 'The range-land was at its unpicturesque worst. For two days the wind\r\nhad raged and ranted over the hilltops, and whooped up the long\r\ncoulees, so that tears stood in the eyes of the Happy Family when they\r\nfaced it; impersonal tears blown into being by the very force of the\r\nwind. Also, when they faced it they rode with bodies aslant over their\r\nsaddle-horns and hats pulled low over their streaming eyes, and with\r\ncoats fastened jealously close. If there were buttons enough, well and\r\ngood; if not, a strap cinched tightly about the middle was considered\r\npretty lucky and not to be despised. Though it was early September,\r\n"sour-dough" coats were much in evidence, for the wind had a chill way\r\nof searching to the very marrow—and even a good, sheepskin-lined\r\n"sour-dough" was not always protection sufficient.', 'When the third day dawned bleakly, literally blown piecemeal from out\r\ndarkness as bleak, the Happy Family rose shiveringly and with sombre\r\ndisapproval of whatever met their blood-shot eyes; dressed hurriedly\r\nin the chill of flapping tent and went out to stagger drunkenly over\r\nto where Patsy, in the mess-tent, was trying vainly to keep the\r\nbiscuits from becoming dust-sprinkled, and sundry pans and tins from\r\ntaking jingling little excursions on their own account. Over the brow\r\nof the next ridge straggled the cavvy, tails and manes whipping in the\r\ngale, the nighthawk swearing so that his voice came booming down to\r\ncamp. Truly, the day opened inauspiciously enough for almost any dire\r\nending.', 'As further evidence, saddling horses for circle resolved itself, as\r\nWeary remarked at the top of his voice to Pink, at his elbow, into "a\r\nfree-for-all broncho busting tournament." For horses have nerves, and\r\nnothing so rasps the nerves of man or beast as a wind that never stops\r\nblowing; which means swaying ropes and popping saddle leather, and\r\ncoat-tails flapping like wet sheets on a clothes line. Horses do not\r\nlike these things, and they are prone to eloquent manifestations of\r\ntheir disapproval.', 'Over by the bed-wagon, a man they called Blink, for want of a better\r\nname, was fighting his big sorrel silently, with that dogged\r\ndetermination which may easily grow malevolent. The sorrel was at best\r\na high-tempered, nervous beast, and what with the wind and the\r\nflapping of everything in sight, and the pitching of half-a-dozen\r\nhorses around him, he was nearly crazed with fear in the abstract.', "Blink was trying to bridle him, and he was not saying a word—which,\r\nin the general uproar, was strange. But Blink seldom did say anything.\r\nHe was one of the aliens who had drifted into the Flying U outfit that\r\nspring, looking for work. Chip had taken him on, and he had stayed. He\r\ncould ride anything in his string, and he was always just where he was\r\nwanted. He never went to town when the others clattered off for a few\r\nhours' celebration more or less mild, he never took part in any of the\r\ncamp fun, and he never offended any man. If any offended him they did\r\nnot know it unless they were observant; if they were, they would see\r\nhis pale lashes wink fast for a minute, and they might read aright the\r\nsign and refrain from further banter. So Blink, though he was counted\r\na good man on roundup, was left pretty much alone when in camp.", "Andy Green, well and none too favorably known down Rocking R way, and\r\nlately adopted into the Happy Family on the recommendation of Pink and\r\nhis own pleasing personality, looped the latigo into the holder, gave\r\nhis own dancing steed a slap of the\r\ndon't-try-to-run-any-whizzers-on-me variety, and went over to help out\r\nBlink.", 'Blink eyed his approach with much the same expression with which he\r\neyed the horse. "I never hollered for assistance," he remarked\r\ngrudgingly when Andy was at his elbow. "When I can\'t handle any of the\r\nskates in my string, I\'ll quit riding and take to sheep-herding."\r\nWhereupon he turned his back as squarely as he might upon Andy and\r\nmade another stealthy grab for the sorrel\'s ears. (There is such a\r\nthing in the range-land as jealousy among riders, and the fame of Andy\r\nGreen had gone afar.)', '"All right. Just as you say, and not as I care a darn," Andy retorted,\r\nand went back to where his own mount stood tail to the wind. He did\r\nnot in the least mind the rebuff; he really felt all the indifference\r\nhis manner portrayed—perhaps even more. He had offered help where\r\nhelp was needed, and that ended it for him. It never occurred to him\r\nthat Blink might feel jealous over Andy\'s hard-earned reputation as a\r\n"tamer of wild ones," or mistake his good nature for patronage.', "Five minutes later, when Chip looked around comprehensively at the lot\r\nof them in various degrees of readiness; saw that Blink was still\r\nfighting silently for mastery of the sorrel and told Andy to go over\r\nand help him get saddled, Andy said nothing of having had his services\r\nrefused, but went. This time, Blink also said nothing, but accepted in\r\nungracious surrender the assistance thus thrust upon him. For on the\r\nrange-land, unless one is in a mind to roll his bed and ride away, one\r\ndoes not question when the leader commands. Andy's attitude was still\r\nthat of indifference; he really thought very little about Blink or his\r\nopinions, and the rapid blinking of the pale lashes was quite lost\r\nupon him.", 'They rode, eighteen ill-natured, uncomfortable cowboys, tumultuously\r\naway from the camp, where canvas bulged and swayed, and loose corners\r\ncracked like pistol shots, over the hill where even the short, prairie\r\ngrass crouched and flattened itself against the sod; where stray\r\npebbles, loosened by the ungentle tread of pitching hoofs, skidded\r\ntwice as far as in calm weather. The gray sky bent threateningly\r\nabove them, wind-torn into flying scud but never showing a hint of\r\nblue. Later there might be rain, sleet, snow—or sunshine, as nature\r\nmight whimsically direct; but for the present she seemed content with\r\nonly the chill wind that blew the very heart out of a man.', 'Whenever Chip pulled up to turn off a couple of riders that they might\r\nsearch a bit of rough country, his voice was sharp with the general\r\ndiscomfort. When men rode away at his command, it was with brows drawn\r\ntogether and vengeful heels digging the short-ribs of horses in quite\r\nas unlovely a mood as themselves.', 'Out at the end of the "circle," Chip divided the remainder of his men\r\ninto two groups for the homeward drive. One group he himself led. The\r\nother owned Weary as temporary commander and galloped off to the left,\r\nskirting close to the foothills of the Bear Paws. In that group rode\r\nPink and Happy Jack, Slim, Andy Green and Blink the silent.', '"I betche we get a blizzard out uh this," gloomed Happy Jack, pulling\r\nhis coat collar up another fraction of an inch. "And the way Chip\'s\r\nheaded us, we got to cross that big flat going back in the thick of\r\nit; chances is, we\'ll git lost."', 'No one made reply to this; it seemed scarcely worth while. Every man\r\nof them rode humped away from the wind, his head drawn down as close\r\nto his shoulders as might be. Conversation under those conditions was\r\nnot likely to become brisk.', '"A fellow that\'ll punch cows for a living," Happy Jack asserted\r\nvenomously after a minute, "had ought to be shut up somewheres. He\r\nsure ain\'t responsible. I betche next summer don\'t see me at it."', '"Aw, shut up. We know you\'re feeble-minded, without you blatting it by\r\nthe hour," snapped Pink, showing never a dimple.', 'Happy Jack tugged again at his collar and made remarks, to which no\r\none paid the slightest attention. They rode in amongst the hills and\r\nnarrow ridges dividing "draws" as narrow, where range cattle would\r\nseek shelter from the cutting blast that raked the open. Then, just as\r\nthey began to realize that the wind was not quite such a raging\r\ntorment, came a new phase of nature\'s unpleasant humor.', 'It was not a blizzard that descended upon them, though when it came\r\nrolling down from the hilltops it much resembled one. The wind had\r\nchanged and brought fog, cold, suffocating, impenetrable. Yet such was\r\nthe mood of them that no one said anything about it. Weary had been\r\nabout to turn off a couple of men, but did not. What was the use,\r\nsince they could not see twenty yards?', 'For a time they rode aimlessly, Weary in the lead. Then, when it grew\r\nno better but worse, he pulled up, just where a high bank shut off the\r\nwind and a tangle of brush barred the way in front.', '"We may as well camp right here till things loosen up a little," he\r\nsaid. "There\'s no use playing blind-man\'s-buff any longer. We\'ll have\r\nsome fire, for a change. Mama! this is sure beautiful weather!"', "At that, they brightened a bit and hurriedly dismounted and hunted dry\r\nwood. Since they were to have a fire, the general tendency was to have\r\na big one; so that when they squatted before it and held out cold,\r\nungloved fingers to the warmth, the flames were leaping high into the\r\nfog and crackling right cheerily. It needed only a few puffs at their\r\ncigarettes to chase the gloom from their faces and put them in the\r\nmood for talk. Only Blink sat apart and stared moodily into the fire,\r\nhis hands clasped listlessly around his knees, and to him they gave no\r\nattention. He was an alien, and a taciturn one at that. The Happy\r\nFamily were accustomed to living clannishly, even on roundup, and only\r\nwhen they tacitly adopted a man, as they had adopted Pink and Irish\r\nand, last but not least important, Andy Green, did they take note of\r\nthat man's mood and demand reasons for any surliness.", '"If Slim would perk up and go run down a grouse or two," Pink observed\r\npointedly, "we\'d be all right for the day. How about it, Slim?"', '"Run \'em down yourself," Slim retorted. "By golly, I ain\'t no lop-ear\r\nbird dog."', '"The law\'s out fer chickens," Happy Jack remarked dolefully.', '"Go on, Happy, and get us a few. You\'ve got your howitzer buckled on,"\r\nfleered Andy Green. Andy it was whose fertile imagination had so\r\nchristened Happy Jack\'s formidable weapon.', '"Aw, gwan!" protested Happy Jack.', '"Happy looks like he was out for a rep," bantered Pink. "He makes me\r\nthink uh the Bad Man in a Western play. All he needs is his hat turned\r\nup in front and his sleeves rolled up to his elbow, like he was\r\nkilling hogs. Happy would make a dandy-looking outlaw, with that gun\r\nand that face uh his."', '"Say, by golly, I bet that\'s what he\'s figurin\' on doing. He ain\'t\r\ngoing to punch cows no more—I bet he\'s thinking about turning out."', '"Well, when I do, you\'ll be the first fellow I lay for," retorted\r\nHappy, with labored wit.', '"You never\'d get a rep shooting at a target the size uh Slim," dimpled\r\nPink. "Is that toy cannon loaded, Happy?"', '"I betche yuh dassen\'t walk off ten paces and let me show yuh,"\r\ngrowled Happy.', 'Pink made as if to rise, then settled back with a sigh. "Ten paces is\r\nfarther than you could drive me from this fire with a club," he said.\r\n"And you couldn\'t see me, in this fog."', '"Say, it is pretty solid," said Weary, looking around him at the\r\nblank, gray wall. "A fellow could sit right here and be a lot ignorant\r\nof what\'s going on around him. A fellow could—"', '"When I was riding down in the San Simon basin," spoke up Andy,\r\nrolling his second cigarette daintily between his finger-tips, "I had\r\na kinda queer experience in a fog, once. It was thick as this one,\r\nand it rolled down just about as sudden and unexpected. That\'s a\r\nplenty wild patch uh country—or it was when I was there. I was riding\r\nfor a Spanish gent that kept white men as a luxury and let the\r\ngreasers do about all the rough work—such as killing off superfluous\r\nneighbors, and running brands artistic, and the like. Oh, he was a gay\r\nmark, all right.', '"But about this other deal: I was out riding alone after a little\r\nbunch uh hosses, one day in the fall. I packed my gun and a pair uh\r\nfield glasses, and every time I rode up onto a mesa I\'d take a long\r\nlook at all the lower country to save riding it. I guess I\'d\r\nprognosticated around like that for two or three hours, when I come\r\nout on a little pinnacle that slopes down gradual toward a neighbor\'s\r\nhome ranch—only the ranch itself was quite a ride back up the basin.', '"I got off my horse and set down on a rock to build me a smoke, and\r\nwas gazing off over the country idle, when I seen a rider come up out\r\nof a little draw and gallop along quartering-like, to pass my pinnacle\r\non the left. You know how a man out alone like that will watch\r\nanything, from a chicken hawk up in the air to a band uh sheep,\r\nwithout any interest in either one, but just to have your eyes on\r\nsomething that\'s alive and moves.', '"So I watched him, idle, while I smoked. Pretty soon I seen another\r\nfellow ride out into sight where the first one had, and hit her up\r\nlively down the trail. I didn\'t do no wondering—I just sat and\r\nwatched \'em both for want uh something better to do."', '"Finding them strays wasn\'t important, I s\'pose?" Happy Jack\r\ninsinuated.', '"It could wait, and did. So I kept an eye on these gazabos, and pretty\r\nsoon I saw the hind fellow turn off the trail and go fogging along\r\nbehind a little rise. He come into sight again, whipping down both\r\nsides like he was heading a wild four-year-old; and that was queer,\r\nbecause the only other live thing in sight was man number one, and I\r\ndidn\'t see no reason why he should be hurting himself to get around to\r\nwindward like that.', '"Maybe it was five minutes I watched \'em: number one loping along like\r\nthere wasn\'t nothing urgent and he was just merely going somewhere and\r\ntaking his time for it, and number two quirting and spurring like\r\nseconds was diamonds."', '"I wish they was that valuable to you," hinted Pink.', '"They ain\'t, so take it easy. Well, pretty soon they got closer\r\ntogether, and then number two unhooked something on his saddle that\r\ncaught the light. There\'s where I got my field glasses into play. I\r\ndrew a bead with \'em, and seen right off it was a gun. And I hadn\'t no\r\nmore than got my brain adjusted to grasp his idea, when he puts it\r\nback and takes down his rope. That there," Andy added naïvely,\r\n"promised more real interest; guns is commonplace.', '"I took down the glasses long enough to size up the layout. Glasses,\r\nyou know, are mighty deceiving when it comes to relative distances,\r\nand a hilltop a mile back looks, through the glass, like just stepping\r\nover a ditch. With the naked eye I could see that they were coming\r\ntogether pretty quick, and they done so.', '"Number one looks back, but whether he seen number two I couldn\'t say;\r\nseemed to me like he just glanced back casual and in the wrong\r\ndirection. Be that is it may, number two edged off a little and rode\r\nin behind a bunch uh mesquite—and then I seen that the trail took a\r\nturn, right there. So he pulled up and stood still till the other one\r\nhad ambled past, and then he whirled out into the trail and swung his\r\nloop.', '"When I\'d got the glasses focused on \'em again, he had number one\r\nsnared, all right, and had took his turns. The hoss he was riding—it\r\nwas a buckskin—set back and yanked number one end over end out uh the\r\nsaddle, and number one\'s hoss stampeded off through the brush. Number\r\ntwo dug in his spurs and went hell-bent off the trail and across\r\ncountry dragging the other fellow—and him bouncing over the rough\r\nspots something horrible.', '"I don\'t know what got the matter uh me, then; I couldn\'t do anything\r\nbut sit there on my rock and watch through the glasses. Anyway, while\r\nthey looked close enough to hit with a rock, they was off a mile or\r\nmore. So while I could see it all I couldn\'t do nothing to prevent. I\r\ncouldn\'t even hear number one yell—supposing he done any hollering,\r\nwhich the chances is he did a plenty. It was for all the world like\r\none uh these moving pictures.', '"I thought it was going to be a case uh dragging to death, but it\r\nwasn\'t; it looked to me a heap worse. Number two dragged his man a\r\nways—I reckon till he was plumb helpless—and then he pulled up and\r\nrode back to where he laid. The fellow tried to get up, and did get\r\npartly on his knees—and number one standing over him, watching.', '"What passed I don\'t know, not having my hearing magnified like my\r\nsight was. I framed it up that number two was getting his past,\r\npresent and future read out to him—what I\'d call a free life reading.\r\nThe rope was pinning his arms down to his sides, and number two was\r\ntaking blamed good care there wasn\'t any slack, so fast as he tried to\r\nget up he was yanked back. From first to last he never had a ghost of\r\na show.', '"Then number two reaches back deliberate and draws his gun and\r\ncommences shooting, and I commences hollering for him to quit it—and\r\nme a mile off and can\'t do nothing! I tell yuh right now, that was\r\nabout the worst deal I ever went up against, to set there on that\r\npinnacle and watch murder done in cold blood, and me plumb helpless.', '"The first shot wasn\'t none fatal, as I could see plainer than was\r\npleasant. Looked to me like he wanted to string out the agony. It was\r\na clear case uh butchery from start to finish; the damnedest,\r\nlowest-down act a white man could be guilty of. He empties his\r\nsix-gun—counting the smoke-puffs—and waits a minute, watching like a\r\ncat does a gopher. I was sweating cold, but I kept my eyes glued to\r\nthem glasses like a man in a nightmare.', '"When he makes sure the fellow\'s dead, he rides alongside and flips\r\noff the rope, with the buckskin snorting and edging off—at the\r\nblood-smell, I reckon. While he\'s coiling his rope, calm as if he\'d\r\njust merely roped a yearling, the buckskin gets his head, plants it\r\nand turns on the fireworks.', '"When that hoss starts in pitching, I come alive and drop the glasses\r\ninto their case and make a jump for my own hoss. If the Lord lets me\r\ncome up with that devil, I aim to deal out a case uh justice on my own\r\nhook; I was in a right proper humor for doing him like he done the\r\nother fellow, and not ask no questions. Looked to me like he had it\r\ncoming, all right.', '"I\'d just stuck my toe in the stirrup, when down comes the fog like a\r\nwet blanket on everything. I couldn\'t see twenty feet—" Andy stopped\r\nand reached for a burning twig to relight his cigarette. The Happy\r\nFamily was breathing hard with the spell of the story.', '"Did yuh git him?" Happy Jack asked hoarsely. Andy took a long puff\r\nat his cigarette. "Well, I— Holy smoke! what\'s the matter with you,\r\nBlink?" For Blink was leaning forward, half crouched, like a cat about\r\nto pounce, and was glaring fixedly at Andy with lips drawn back in a\r\nsnarl. The Happy Family looked, then stared.', 'Blink relaxed, shrugged his shoulders and grinned unmirthfully. He got\r\nup, pulled up his chaps with the peculiar, hitching gesture which\r\ncomes with long practice and grows to be second nature, and stared\r\nback defiantly at the wondering faces lighted by the dancing flames.\r\nHe turned his back coolly upon them and walked away to where his horse\r\nstood, took up the reins and stuck his toe in the stirrup, went up and\r\nlanded in the saddle ready for anything. Then he wheeled the big\r\nsorrel so that he faced those at the camp-fire.', '"A man\'s a damned fool, Andy Green, to see more than is meant for him\r\nto see. He\'s plumb crazy to go round blatting all he knows. You won\'t\r\ntell that tale again, mi amigo!"', 'There was the pop of a pistol, a puff of blue against the gray, and\r\nthen the fog reached out and gathered Blink and the sorrel to itself.\r\nOnly the clatter of galloping hoofs came to them from behind the damp\r\ncurtain. Andy Green was lying on his back in the grass, his cigarette\r\nsmoking dully in his fingers, a fast widening red streak trailing down\r\nfrom his temple.', 'The Happy Family rose like a covey of frightened chickens before the\r\nechoes were done playing with the gun-bark. On the heels of Blink\'s\r\nshot came the crack of Happy Jack\'s "howitzer" as he fired blindly\r\ntoward the hoof-beats. There was more shooting while they scurried to\r\nwhere their horses, snorting excitement, danced uneasily at the edge\r\nof the bushes. Only one man spoke, and that was Pink, who stopped just\r\nas he was about to swing into the saddle.', '"Damme for leaving my gun in camp! I\'ll stay with Andy. Go on—and if\r\nyuh don\'t get him, I\'ll—" he turned back, cursing hysterically, and\r\nknelt beside the long figure in the grass. There was a tumult of sound\r\nas the three raced off in pursuit, so close that the flight of the\r\nfugitive was still distinct in the fog.', 'While they raced they cursed the fog that shielded from their\r\nvengeance their quarry, and made such riding as theirs a blind gamble\r\nwith the chances all in favor of broken bones; their only comfort the\r\nknowledge that Blink could see no better than could they. They did not\r\ntalk, just at first. They did not even wonder if Andy was dead. Every\r\nnerve, every muscle and every thought was concentrated upon the\r\npursuit of Blink. It was the instant rising to meet an occasion\r\nundreamed of in advance, to do the only thing possible without loss of\r\na second in parley. Truly, it were ill for Blink to fall into the\r\nhands of those three in that mood.', "They rode with quirt and spur, guided only by the muffled\r\npluckety-pluck, pluckety-pluck of Blink's horse fleeing always just\r\nbefore. Whenever the hoof-beats seemed a bit closer, Happy Jack would\r\nlift his long-barreled .45 and send a shot at random toward the sound.\r\nOr Weary or Slim would take a chance with their shorter guns. But\r\nnever once did they pull rein for steep or gulley, and never once did\r\nthe hoof-beats fail to come back to them from out the fog.", "The chase had led afar and the pace was telling on their mounts, which\r\nbreathed asthmatically. Slim, best he could do, was falling behind.\r\nWeary's horse stumbled and went to his knees, so that Happy Jack\r\nforged ahead just when the wind, puffing up from the open, blew aside\r\nthe gray fog-wall. It was not a minute, nor half that; but it was long\r\nenough for Happy Jack to see, clear and close, Blink pausing\r\nirresolutely upon the edge of a deep, brush-filled gulley. Happy Jack\r\ngave a hoarse croak of triumph and fired, just as the fog-curtain\r\nswayed back maddeningly. Happy Jack nearly wept with pure rage. Weary\r\nand Slim came up, and together they galloped to the place, riding by\r\ninstinct of direction, for there was no longer any sound to guide.", "Ten minutes they spent searching the gulley's edge. Then they saw\r\ndimly, twenty feet below, a huddled object half-hidden in the brush.\r\nThey climbed down none too warily, though they knew well what might be\r\nlying, venomous as a coiled rattler, in wait for them below. Slipping\r\nand sliding in the fog-dampened grass, they reached the spot, to find\r\nthe big sorrel crumpled there, dead. They searched anxiously and\r\nfutilely for more, but Blink was not there, nor was there anything to\r\nshow that he had ever been there. Then not fear, perhaps, but caution,\r\ncame to Happy Jack.", '"Aw, say! he\'s got away on us—the skunk! He\'s down there in the\r\nbrush, somewheres, waiting for somebody to go in and drag him out by\r\nthe ear. I betche he\'s laying low, right now, waiting for a chance to\r\npot-shot us. We better git back out uh this." He edged away, his eyes\r\non the thicket just below. To ride in there was impossible, even to\r\nthe Happy Family in whole or in part. To go in afoot was not at all to\r\nthe liking of Happy Jack.', 'Slim gave a comprehensive, round-eyed stare at the unpromising\r\nsurroundings, and followed Happy Jack. "By golly, that\'s right. Yuh\r\ndon\'t git me into no hole like that," he assented.', 'Weary, foolhardy to the last, stayed longest; but even Weary could not\r\nbut admit that the case was hopeless. The brush was thick and filled\r\nthe gully, probably from end to end. Riding through it was impossible,\r\nand hunting it through on foot would be nothing but suicide, with a\r\nman like Blink hidden away in its depths. They climbed back to the\r\nrim, remounted and rode, as straight as might be, for the camp-fire\r\nand what lay beside, with Pink on guard.', 'It was near noon when, through the lightening fog, they reached the\r\nplace and discovered that Andy, though unconscious, was not dead. They\r\nfound, upon examination of his hurt, that the bullet had ploughed\r\nalong the side of his head above his ear; but just how serious it\r\nmight be they did not know. Pink, having a fresh horse and aching for\r\naction, mounted and rode in much haste to camp, that the bed-wagon\r\nmight be brought out to take Andy in to the ranch and the\r\nministrations of the Little Doctor. Also, he must notify the crew and\r\nget them out searching for Blink.', 'All that night and the next day the cowboys rode, and the next. They\r\nraked the foothills, gulley by gulley, their purpose grim. It would\r\nprobably be a case of shoot-on-sight with them, and nothing saved\r\nBlink save the all-important fact that never once did any man of the\r\nFlying U gain sight of him. He had vanished completely after that\r\nfleeting glimpse Happy Jack had gained, and in the end the Flying U\r\nwas compelled to own defeat.', 'Upon one point they congratulated themselves: Andy, bandaged as he\r\nwas, had escaped with a furrow ploughed through the scalp, though it\r\nwas not the fault of Blink that he was alive and able to discuss the\r\naffair with the others—more exactly, to answer the questions they\r\nfired at him.', '"Didn\'t you recognize him as being the murderer?" Weary asked him\r\ncuriously.', 'Andy moved uneasily on his bed. "No, I didn\'t. By gracious, you must\r\nthink I\'m a plumb fool!"', '"Well, yuh sure hit the mark, whether yuh meant to or not," Pink\r\nasserted. "He was the jasper, all right. Look how he was glaring at\r\nyuh while you were telling about it. He knew he was the party, and\r\nhaving a guilty conscience, he naturally supposed yuh recognized him\r\nfrom the start."', '"Well, I didn\'t," snapped Andy ungraciously, and they put it down to\r\nthe peevishness of invalidism and overlooked the tone.', '"Chip has given his description in to the sheriff," soothed Weary,\r\n"and if he gets off he\'s sure a good one. And I heard that the sheriff\r\nwired down to the San Simon country and told \'em their man was up\r\nhere. Mama! What bad breaks a man will make when he\'s on the dodge! If\r\nBlink had kept his face closed and acted normal, nobody would have got\r\nnext. Andy didn\'t know he was the fellow that done it. But it sure was\r\nqueer, the way the play come up. Wasn\'t it, Andy?"', 'Andy merely grunted. He did not like to dwell upon the subject, and he\r\nshowed it plainly.', '"By golly! he must sure have had it in for that fellow," mused Slim\r\nponderously, "to kill him the way Andy says he did. By golly, yuh\r\ncan\'t wonder his eyes stuck out when he heard Andy telling us all\r\nabout it!"', '"I betche he lays for Andy yet, and gits him," predicted Happy Jack\r\nfelicitously. "He won\'t rest whilst an eye-witness is running around\r\nloose. I betche he\'s cached in the hills right now, watching his\r\nchance."', '"Oh, go to hell, the whole lot of yuh!" flared Andy, rising to an\r\nelbow. "What the dickens are yuh roosting around here for? Why don\'t\r\nyuh go on out to camp where yuh belong? You\'re a nice bunch to set\r\naround comforting the sick! Vamos, darn yuh!"', "Whereupon they took the hint and departed, assuring Andy, by way of\r\nfarewell, that he was an unappreciative cuss and didn't deserve any\r\nsympathy or sick-calls. They also condoled openly with Pink because he\r\nhad been detailed as nurse, and advised him to sit right down on Andy\r\nif he got too sassy and haughty over being shot up by a real outlaw.\r\nThey said that any fool could build himself a bunch of trouble with a\r\nhomicidal lunatic like Blink, and it wasn't anything to get vain\r\nover.", 'Pink slammed the door upon their jibes and offered Andy a cigarette he\r\nhad just rolled; not that Andy was too sick to roll his own, but\r\nbecause Pink was notably soft-hearted toward a sick man and was prone\r\nto indulge himself in trifling attentions.', '"Yuh don\'t want to mind that bunch," he placated. "They mean all\r\nright, but they just can\'t help joshing a man to death."', 'Andy accepted also a light for the cigarette, and smoked moodily. "It\r\nain\'t their joshing," he explained after a minute "It\'s puzzling over\r\nwhat I can\'t understand that gets on my nerves. I can\'t see through\r\nthe thing, Pink, no way I look at it."', '"Looks plain enough to me," Pink answered. "Uh course, it\'s funny\r\nBlink should be the man, and be setting there listening—"', '"Yes, but darn it all, Pink, there\'s a funnier side to it than that,\r\nand it\'s near driving me crazy trying to figure it out. Yuh needn\'t\r\ntell anybody, Pink, but it\'s like this: I was just merely and simply\r\nromancing when I told that there blood-curdling tale! I never was\r\nsouth uh the Wyoming line except when I was riding in a circus and\r\ntoured through, and that\'s the truth. I never was down in the San\r\nSimon basin. I never set on no pinnacle with no field glasses—" Andy\r\nstopped short his labored confession to gaze, with deep disgust, upon\r\nPink\'s convulsed figure. "Well," he snapped, settling back on the\r\npillow, "laugh, darn yuh! and show your ignorance! By gracious, I\r\nwish I could see the joke!" He reached up gingerly and readjusted\r\nthe bandage on his head, eyed Pink sourly a moment, and with a grunt\r\neloquent of the mood he was in turned his face to the wall.', 'When Andy Green, fresh-combed and shining with soap and towel polish,\r\nwalked into the dining-room of the Dry Lake Hotel, he felt not the\r\nslightest premonition of what was about to befall. His chief sensation\r\nwas the hunger which comes of early rising and of many hours spent in\r\nthe open, and beyond that he was hoping that the Chinaman cook had\r\nmade some meat-pie, like he had the week before. His eyes, searching\r\nunobtrusively the long table bearing the unmistakable signs of many\r\nother hungry men gone before—for Andy was late—failed to warn him.\r\nHe pulled out his chair and sat down, still looking for meat-pie.', '"Good afternoon!" cried an eager, feminine voice just across the\r\ntable.', 'Andy started guiltily. He had been dimly aware that some one was\r\nsitting there, but, being occupied with other things, had not given a\r\nthought to the sitter, or a glance. Now he did both while he said\r\ngood afternoon with perfunctory politeness.', '"Such a beautiful day, isn\'t it? so invigorating, like rare, old\r\nwine!"', "Andy assented somewhat dubiously; it had never just struck him that\r\nway; he thought fleetingly that perhaps it was because he had never\r\ncome across any rare, old wine. He ventured another glance. She was\r\nnot young, and she wore glasses, behind which twinkled very bright\r\neyes of a shade of brown. She had unpleasantly regular hair waves on\r\nher temples, and underneath the waves showed streaks of gray. Also,\r\nshe wore a black silk waist, and somebody's picture made into a brooch\r\nat her throat. Further, Andy dared not observe. It was enough for one\r\nglance. He looked again for the much-desired meat-pie.", 'The strange lady ingratiatingly passed him the bread. "You\'re a\r\ncowboy, aren\'t you?" was the disconcerting question that accompanied\r\nthe bread.', '"Well, I—er—I punch cows," he admitted guardedly, his gaze elsewhere\r\nthan on her face.', '"I knew you were a cowboy, the moment you entered the door! I could\r\ntell by the tan and the straight, elastic walk, and the silk\r\nhandkerchief knotted around your throat in that picturesque fashion.\r\n(Oh, I\'m older than you, and dare speak as I think!) I\'ve read a great\r\ndeal about cowboys, and I do admire you all as a type of free,\r\ngreat-hearted, noble manhood!"', 'Andy looked exactly as if someone had caught him at something\r\nexceedingly foolish. He tried to sugar his coffee calmly, and so sent\r\nit sloshing all over the saucer.', '"Do you live near here?" she asked next, beaming upon him in the\r\northodox, motherly fashion.', '"Yes, ma\'am, not very near," he was betrayed into saying—and she\r\nmight make what she could of it. He had not said "ma\'am" before since\r\nhe had gone to school.', '"Oh, I\'ve heard how you Western folks measure distances," she teased.\r\n"About how many miles?"', '"About twenty."', '"I suppose that is not far, to you knights of the plains. At home it\r\nwould be called a dreadfully long journey. Why, I have known numbers\r\nof old men and women who have never been so far from their own doors\r\nin their lives! What would you think, I wonder, of their little forty\r\nacre farms?"', "Andy had been brought to his sixteenth tumultuous birthday on a\r\nhalf-acre in the edge of a good-sized town, but he did not say so. He\r\nshook his head vaguely and said he didn't know. Andy Green, however,\r\nwas not famous for clinging ever to the truth.", '"You out here in this great, wide, free land, with the free winds ever\r\nblowing and the clouds—"', '"Will you pass the butter, please?" Andy hated to interrupt, but he\r\nwas hungry.', 'The strange lady passed the butter and sent with it a smile. "I have\r\nread and heard so much about this wild, free life, and my heart has\r\ngone out to the noble fellows living their lonely life with their\r\ncattle and their faithful dogs, lying beside their camp-fires at night\r\nwhile the stars stood guard—"', 'Andy forgot his personal embarrassment and began to perk up his ears.\r\nThis was growing interesting.', '"—And I have felt how lonely they must be, with their rude fare and\r\nfew pleasures, and what a field there must be among them for a great\r\nand noble work; to uplift them and bring into their lonely lives a\r\nbroader, deeper meaning; to help them to help themselves to be\r\nbetter, nobler men and women—"', '"We don\'t have any lady cowpunchers out here," interposed Andy mildly.', 'The strange lady had merely gone astray a bit, being accustomed to\r\naddressing Mothers\' Meetings and the like. She recovered herself\r\neasily. "Nobler men, the bulwarks of our nation." She stopped and eyed\r\nAndy archly. Andy, having observed that her neck was scrawny, with\r\ncertain cords down the sides that moved unpleasantly when she talked,\r\ntried not to look.', '"I wonder if you can guess what brings me out here, away from home and\r\nfriends! Can you guess?"', 'Andy thought of several things, but he could not feel that it would be\r\npolite to mention them. Agent for complexion stuff, for instance, and\r\nnext to that, wanting a husband. He shook his head again and looked at\r\nhis potato.', '"You can\'t guess?" The tone was the one commonly employed for the\r\nencouragement, and consequent demoralization of, a primary class. Andy\r\nrealized that he was being talked down to, and his combativeness\r\nawoke. "Well, away back in my home town, a woman\'s club has been\r\nthinking of all you lonely fellows, and have felt their hearts swell\r\nwith a desire to help you—so far from home and mother\'s influence,\r\nwith only the coarse pleasures of the West, and amid all the\r\ntemptations that lie in wait—" She caught herself back from\r\nspeech-making—"and they have sent me—away out here—to be your\r\nfriend; to help you to help yourselves become better, truer men\r\nand—" She did not say women, though, poor soul, she came near it.\r\n"So, I am going to be your friend. I want to get in touch with you\r\nall, first; to win your confidence and teach you to look upon me in\r\nthe light of a mother. Then, when I have won your confidence, I want\r\nto organize a Cowboys\' Mutual Improvement and Social Society, to help\r\nyou in the way of self-improvement and to resist the snares laid for\r\nhomeless boys like you. Don\'t you think I\'m very—brave?" She was\r\nsmiling at him again, leaning back in her chair and regarding him\r\nplayfully over her glasses.', '"You sure are," Andy assented, deliberately refraining from saying\r\n"yes, ma\'am," as had been his impulse.', '"To come away out here—all alone—among all you wild cowboys with\r\nyour guns buckled on and your wicked little mustangs—Are you sure you\r\nwon\'t shoot me?"', 'Andy eyed her pityingly. If she meant it, he thought, she certainly\r\nwas wabbly in her mind. If she thought that was the only kind of talk\r\nhe could savvy, then she was a blamed idiot; either way, he felt\r\nantagonistic. "The law shall be respected in your case," he told her,\r\nvery gravely.', 'She smiled almost as if she could see the joke; after which she became\r\ntwitteringly, eagerly in earnest. "Since you live near here, you must\r\nknow the Whitmores. Miss Whitmore came out here, two or three years\r\nago, and married her brother\'s coachman, I believe—though I\'ve heard\r\nconflicting stories about it; some have said he was an artist, and\r\nothers that he was a jockey, or horse-trainer. I heard too that he was\r\na cowboy; but Miss Whitmore certainly wrote about this young man\r\ndriving her brother\'s carriage. However, she is married and I have a\r\nletter of introduction to her. The president of our club used to be a\r\nschoolmate of her mother. I shall stop with them—I have heard so much\r\nabout the Western hospitality—and shall get into touch with my\r\ncowboys from the vantage point of proximity. Did you say you know\r\nthem?"', '"I work for them," Andy told her truthfully in his deep amazement, and\r\nimmediately repented and wished that he had not been so virtuous. With\r\nAndy, to wish was to do—given the opportunity.', '"Then I can go with you out to their farm—ranchero! How nice! And on\r\nthe way you can tell me all about yourself and your life and\r\nhopes—because I do want to get in touch with you all, you know—and\r\nI\'ll tell you all my plans for you; I have some beautiful plans! And\r\nwe\'ll be very good friends by the time we reach our destination, I\'m\r\nsure. I want you to feel from the start that I am a true friend, and\r\nthat I have your welfare very much at heart. Without the confidence of\r\nmy cowboys, I can do nothing. Are there any more at home like you?"', 'Andy looked at her suspiciously, but it was so evident she never meant\r\nto quote comic opera, that he merely wondered anew. He struggled\r\nfeebly against temptation, and fell from grace quite willingly. It\r\nisn\'t polite to "throw a load" at a lady, but then Andy felt that\r\nneither was it polite for a lady to come out with the avowed intention\r\nof improving him and his fellows; it looked to him like butting in\r\nwhere she was not wanted, or needed.', '"Yes, ma\'am, there\'s quite a bunch, and they\'re pretty bad. I don\'t\r\nbelieve you can do much for \'em." He spoke regretfully.', '"Do they—drink?" she asked, leaning forward and speaking in the\r\nhushed voice with which some women approach a tabooed subject.', '"Yes ma\'am, they do. They\'re hard drinkers. And they"—he eyed her\r\nspeculatively, trying to guess the worst sins in her category—"they\r\nplay cards—gamble—and swear, and smoke cigarettes and—"', '"All the more need of someone to help them overcome," she decided\r\nsolemnly. "What you need is a coffee-house and reading room here, so\r\nthat the young men will have some place to go other than the saloons.\r\nI shall see to that right away. And with the Mutual Improvement and\r\nSocial Society organized and working smoothly, and a library of\r\nstandard works for recreation, together with earnest personal efforts\r\nto promote temperance and clean-living, I feel that a wonderful work\r\ncan be done. I saw you drive into town, so I know you can take me out\r\nwith you; I hope you are going to start soon. I feel very impatient\r\nto reach the field and put my sickle to the harvest."', "Andy mentally threw up his hands before this unshakable person. He had\r\nmeant to tell her that he had come on horseback, but she had\r\nforestalled him. He had meant to discourage her—head her off, he\r\ncalled it to himself. But there seemed no way of doing it. He pushed\r\nback his chair and rose, though he had not tasted his pie, and it was\r\nlemon pie at that. He had some faint notion of hurrying out of town\r\nand home before she could have time to get ready; but she followed him\r\nto the door and chirped over his shoulder that it wouldn't take her\r\ntwo minutes to put on her wraps. Andy groaned.", "He tried—or started to try—holding out at Rusty Brown's till she\r\ngave up in despair; but it occurred to him that Chip had asked him to\r\nhurry back. Andy groaned again, and got the team.", 'She did not wait for him to drive around to the hotel for her;\r\npossibly she suspected his intentions. At any rate, she came nipping\r\ndown the street toward the stable just as he was hooking the last\r\ntrace, and she was all ready and had a load of bags and bundles.', '"I\'m not going to begin by making trouble for you," she twittered. "I\r\nthought I could just as well come down here to the wagon as have you\r\ndrive back to the hotel. And my trunk did not come on the train with\r\nme, so I\'m all ready."', 'Andy, having nothing in mind that he dared say to a lady, helped her\r\ninto the wagon.', 'At sundown or thereabouts—for the days were short and he had a load\r\nof various things besides care—Andy let himself wearily into the\r\nbunk-house where was assembled the Happy Family. He merely grunted\r\nwhen they spoke to him, and threw himself heavily down upon his bunk.', '"For Heaven\'s sake, somebody roll me a cigarette! I\'m too wore out to\r\ndo a thing, and I haven\'t had a smoke since dinner," he groaned, after\r\na minute.', '"Sick?" asked Pink solicitously.', '"Sick as a dog! water, water!" moaned Andy. All at once he rolled over\r\nupon his face and shook with laughter more than a little hysterical,\r\nand to the questioning of the Happy Family gave no answer but howls.\r\nThe Happy Family began to look at one another uneasily.', '"Aw, let up!" Happy Jack bellowed. "You give a man the creeps just to\r\nlisten at yuh."', '"I\'m going to empty the water-bucket over yuh in a minute," Pink\r\nthreatened, "Go get it, Cal; it\'s half full."', 'Andy knew well the metal of which the Happy Family was made, and the\r\nnight was cool for a ducking. He rolled back so that they could see\r\nhis face, and struggled for calm. In a minute he sat up and merely\r\ngurgled.', '"Well, say, I had to do something or die," he explained, gasping.\r\n"I\'ve gone through a heap, the last few hours, and I was right where I\r\ncouldn\'t do a thing. By gracious, I struck the ranch about as near\r\nbug-house as a man can get and recover. Where\'s a cigarette?"', '"What you\'ve gone through—and I don\'t give a cuss what it is—ain\'t a\r\nmarker for what\'s going to happen if yuh don\'t loosen up on the\r\nhistory," said Jack Bates firmly.', 'Andy smoked hungrily while he surveyed the lot. "How calm and innocent\r\nyuh all look," he observed musingly, "with your hats on and saying\r\nwords that\'s rude, and smoking the vile weed regardless, never\r\ndreaming what\'s going to drop, pretty soon quick. Yuh make me think\r\nof a hymn-song my step-mother used to sing a lot, about \'They dreamed\r\nnot of danger, those sinners of old, whom—"', '"Hand me the water bucket," directed Pink musically.', '"Oh, well—take it from the shoulder, then; I was only trying to lead\r\nup to it gradual, but yuh will have it raw. You poor, dear cowboys,\r\nthat live your lonely lives watching over your cattle with your\r\nfaithful dogs and the stars for company, you\'re going to be\r\nimproved. (You\'ll sure stand a lot of it, too!) A woman\'s relief\r\nclub back East has felt the burden of your no-accountness and general\r\norneriness, and has sent one of its leading members out here to reform\r\nyuh. You\'re going to be hazed into a Cowboys\' Mutual Improvement and\r\nSocial Society, and quit smoking cigarettes and cussing your hosses\r\nand laying over Rusty\'s bar when yuh ride into town; and for pleasure\r\nand recreation you\'re going to read Tennyson\'s poems, and when yuh get\r\ncaught out in a blizzard yuh\'ll be heeled with Whittier\'s Snowbound,\r\npocket edition. Emerson and Browning and Shakespeare and Gatty" (Andy\r\nmisquoted; he meant Goethe) "and all them stiffs is going to be set\r\nbefore yuh regular and in your mind constant, purging it of unclean\r\nthoughts, and grammar is going to be learnt yuh as a side-line. Yuh—"', '"Mama mine," broke in Weary. "I have thought sometimes, when Andy\r\nbroke loose with that imagination uh his, that he\'d gone the limit;\r\nbut next time he always raises the limit out uh sight. He\'s like the\r\nGood Book says: he\'s prone to lie as the sparks fly-upward."', 'Andy gazed belligerently at the skeptical group. "I brought her out\r\nfrom town," he said doggedly, "and whilst I own up to having an\r\nimagination, she\'s stranger than fiction. She\'d make the fellow that\r\nwrote "She" lay down with a headache. She\'s come out here to help us\r\ncowboys live nobler, better lives. She\'s going to learn yuh Browning,\r\ndarn yuh! and Emerson and Gatty. She said so. She\'s going to fill your\r\nhearts with love for dumb creatures, so when yuh get set afoot out on\r\nthe range, or anything like that, yuh won\'t put in your time cussing\r\nthe miles between you and camp; you\'ll have a pocket edition of \'Much\r\nAdo About Nothing\' to read, or the speech Mark Anthony made when he\r\nwas running for office. Or supposing yuh left \'em all in camp, yuh\'ll\r\nstudy nature.', 'There\'s sermons in stones, she says. She\'s going to send for a pocket\r\nlibrary that can easy be took on roundup—"', '"Say, I guess that\'s about enough," interrupted Pink restlessly. "We\r\nall admit you\'re the biggest liar that ever come West of the\r\nMississippi, without you laying it on any deeper."', 'Whereupon Andy rose in wrath and made a suggestive movement with his\r\nfist. "If I was romancing," he declared indignantly, "I\'d do a\r\nsmoother job; when I do lie, I notice yuh all believe it—till yuh\r\nfind out different. And by gracious yuh might do as much when I\'m\r\ntelling the truth! Go up to the White House and see, darn yuh! If yuh\r\ndon\'t find Miss Verbena Martin up there telling the Little Doctor how\r\nher heart goes out to her dear cowboys and how she\'s going to get in\r\ntouch with \'em and help \'em lead nobler, better lives, you can kick me\r\nall round the yard. And I hope, by gracious, she does improve yuh!\r\nYuh sure do need it a lot."', 'The Happy Family discussed the tale freely and without regard for the\r\nfeelings of Andy; they even became heated and impolite, and they made\r\nthreats. They said that a liar like him ought to be lynched or gagged,\r\nand that he was a disgrace to the outfit. In the end, however, they\r\ndecided to go and see, just to prove to Andy that they knew he lied.\r\nAnd though it was settled that Weary and Pink should be the\r\ninvestigating committee, by the time they were halfway to the White\r\nHouse they had the whole Happy Family trailing at their heels. A light\r\nsnow had begun to fall since dark, and they hunched their shoulders\r\nagainst it as they went. Grouped uncomfortably just outside the circle\r\nof light cast through the unshaded window, they gazed silently in upon\r\nChip and the Little Doctor and J.G. Whitmore, and upon one other; a\r\nstrange lady in a black silk shirtwaist and a gold watch suspended\r\nfrom her neck by a chaste, black silken cord; a strange lady with\r\nsymmetrical waves in her hair and gray on her temples, and with\r\nglasses and an eager way of speaking.', "She was talking very rapidly and animatedly, and the others were\r\nlistening and stealing glances now and then at one another. Once,\r\nwhile they watched, the Little Doctor looked at Chip and then turned\r\nher face toward the window. She was biting her lips in the way the\r\nHappy Family had learned to recognize as a great desire to laugh. It\r\nall looked suspicious and corroborative of Andy's story, and the\r\nHappy Family shifted their feet uneasily in the loose snow.", 'They watched, and saw the strange lady clasp her hands together and\r\nlean forward, and where her voice had before come to them with no\r\nwords which they could catch distinctly, they heard her say something\r\nquite clearly in her enthusiasm: "Eight real cowboys here, almost\r\nwithin reach! I must see them before I sleep! I must get in touch with\r\nthem at once, and show them that I am a true friend. Come, Mrs.\r\nBennett! Won\'t you take me where they are and let me meet my boys? for\r\nthey are mine in spirit; my heart goes out to them—"', 'The Happy Family waited to hear no more, but went straightway back\r\nwhence they had come, and their going savored of flight.', '"Mama mine! she\'s coming down to the bunkhouse!" said Weary under his\r\nbreath, and glanced back over his shoulder at the White House bulking\r\nlarge in the night. "Let\'s go on down to the stable and roost in the\r\nhay a while."', '"She\'ll out-wind us, and be right there waiting when we come back,"\r\nobjected Andy, with the wisdom gained from his brief acquaintance with\r\nthe lady. "If she\'s made up her mind to call on us, there\'s no way\r\nunder Heaven to head her off."', 'They halted by the bunk-house door, undecided whether to go in or to\r\nstay out in the open.', '"By golly, she don\'t improve me!" Slim asserted pettishly. "I hate\r\nbooks like strychnine, and, by golly, she can\'t make me read \'em,\r\nneither."', '"If there\'s anything I do despise it\'s po\'try," groaned Cal Emmett.', '"Emerson and Browning and Shakespeare and Gatty," named Andy\r\ngloomily.', 'Whereat Pink suddenly pushed open the door and went in as goes one who\r\nknows exactly what he is about to do. They followed him distressfully\r\nand silently. Pink went immediately to his bunk and began pulling off\r\nhis boots.', '"I\'m going to bed," he told them. "You fellows can stay up and\r\nentertain her if yuh want to—I won\'t!"', 'They caught the idea and disrobed hastily, though the evening was\r\nyoung. Irish blew out the lamp and dove under the blankets just as\r\nvoices came faintly from up the hill, so that when Chip rapped a\r\nwarning with his knuckles on the door, there was no sound within save\r\nan artificial snore from the corner where lay Pink. Chip was not in\r\nthe habit of knocking before he entered, but he repeated the summons\r\nwith emphasis.', '"Who\'s there-e?" drawled sleepily a voice—the voice of Weary.', '"Oh, I do believe they\'ve retired!" came, in a perturbed feminine\r\ntone, to the listening ears of the Happy Family.', '"Gone to bed?" cried Chip gravely.', '"Hours ago," lied Andy fluently. "We\'re plumb wore out. What\'s\r\nhappened?"', '"Oh, don\'t disturb the poor fellows! They\'re tired and need their\r\nrest," came the perturbed tone again. After that the voices and the\r\nfootsteps went up the hill again, and the Happy Family breathed freer.\r\nIncidentally, Pink stopped snoring and made a cigarette.', "Going to bed at seven-thirty or thereabouts was not the custom of the\r\nHappy Family, but they stayed under the covers and smoked and\r\ndiscussed the situation. They dared not have a light, and the night\r\nwas longer than they had ever known a night to be, for it was late\r\nbefore they slept. It was well that Miss Verbena Martin could not\r\noverhear their talk, which was unchivalrous and unfriendly in the\r\nextreme. The general opinion seemed to be that old maid improvers\r\nwould better stay at home where they might possibly be welcome, and\r\nthat when the Happy Family wanted improving they would let her know.\r\nCal Emmett said that he wouldn't mind, if they had only sent a young,\r\npretty one. Happy Jack prophesied plenty of trouble, and boasted that\r\nshe couldn't haul him into no s'ciety. Slim declared again that by\r\ngolly, she wouldn't do no improving on him, and the others—Weary\r\nand Irish and Pink and Jack Bates and Andy—discussed ways and means\r\nand failed always to agree. When each one hoots derision at all plans\r\nbut his own, it is easy guessing what will be the result. In this\r\nparticular instance the result was voices raised in argument—voices\r\nthat reached Chip, grinning and listening on the porch of the White\r\nHouse—and tardy slumber overtaking a disgruntled Happy Family on the\r\nbrink of violence.", 'It was not a particularly happy Family that woke to memory and a snowy\r\nSunday; woke late, because of the disturbing evening. When they spoke\r\nto one another their voices were but growls, and when they trailed\r\nthrough the snow to their breakfast they went in moody silence.', "They had just brightened a bit before Patsy's Sunday breakfast, which\r\nincluded hot-cakes and maple syrup, when the door was pushed quietly\r\nopen and the Little Doctor came in, followed closely by Miss Martin;\r\nan apologetic Little Doctor, who seemed, by her very manner of\r\nentering, to implore them not to blame her for the intrusion. Miss\r\nMartin was not apologetic. She was disconcertingly eager and glad to\r\nmeet them, and pathetically anxious to win their favor.", 'Miss Martin talked, and the Happy Family ate hurriedly and with\r\nlowered eyelids. Miss Martin asked questions, and the Happy Family\r\nkicked one another\'s shins under the table by way of urging someone to\r\nreply; for this reason there was a quite perceptible pause between\r\nquestion and answer, and the answer was invariably "the soul of\r\nwit"—according to that famous recipe. Miss Martin told them naively\r\nall about her hopes and her plans and herself, and about the distant\r\nwoman\'s club that took so great an interest in their welfare, and the\r\nHappy Family listened dejectedly and tried to be polite. Also, they\r\ndid not relish the hot-cakes as usual, and Patsy had half the batter\r\nleft when the meal was over, instead of being obliged to mix more, as\r\nwas usually the case.', 'When they had eaten, the Happy Family filed out decorously and went\r\nhastily down to the stables. They did not say much, but they did\r\nglance over their shoulders uneasily once or twice.', '"The old girl is sure hot on our trail," Pink remarked when they were\r\nsafely through the big gate. "She must uh got us mixed up with some\r\nWild West show, in her mind. Josephine!"', '"Well, by golly, she don\'t improve me," Slim repeated for about the\r\ntenth time.', 'The horses were all fed and everything tidy for the day, and several\r\nsaddles were being hauled down significantly from their pegs, when\r\nIrish delivered himself of a speech, short but to the point. Irish had\r\nbeen very quiet and had taken no part in the discussion that had waxed\r\nhot all that morning.', '"Now, see here," he said in his decided way. "Maybe it didn\'t strike\r\nyou as anything but funny—which it sure is. But yuh want to remember\r\nthat the old girl has come a dickens of a long ways to do us some\r\ngood. She\'s been laying awake nights thinking about how we\'ll get to\r\ncalling her something nice: Angel of the Roundup, maybe—you can\'t\r\ntell, she\'s that romantic. And right here is where I\'m going to give\r\nthe old girl the worth of her money. It won\'t hurt us, letting her\r\ntalk wild and foolish at us once a week, maybe; and the poor old\r\nthing\'ll just be tickled to death thinking what a lot uh good she\'s\r\ndoing. She won\'t stay long, and—well, I go in. If she\'ll feel better\r\nand more good to the world improving me, she\'s got my permission. I\r\nguess I can stand it a while."', 'The Happy Family looked at him queerly, for if there was a black sheep\r\nin the flock, Irish was certainly the man; and to have Irish take the\r\nstand he did was, to say the least, unexpected.', 'Cal Emmett blurted the real cause of their astonishment. "You\'ll have\r\nto sign the pledge, first pass," he said. "That\'s going to be the ante\r\nin her game. How—"', '"Well, I don\'t play nobody\'s hand, or stake anybody\'s chips, but my\r\nown," Irish retorted, the blood showing under the tan on his cheeks.', '"And we won\'t das\'t roll a cigarette, even, by golly!" reminded Slim.\r\nFor Miss Martin, whether intentionally or not, had made plain to them\r\nthe platform of the new society.', 'Irish got some deep creases between his eyebrows, and put back his\r\nsaddle. "You can do as yuh like," he said, coldly. "I\'m going to stay\r\nand go to meeting this afternoon, according to her invite. If it\'s\r\ngoing to make that poor old freak feel any better thinking she\'s a\r\nreal missionary—" He turned and walked out of the stable without\r\nfinishing the sentence, and the Happy Family stood quite still and\r\nwatched him go.', 'Pink it was who first spoke. "I ain\'t the boy to let any long-legged\r\nson-of-a-gun like Irish hit a gait I can\'t follow," he dimpled, and\r\ntook the saddle reluctantly off Toots. "If he can stand it, I guess I\r\ncan."', 'Weary loosened his latigo. "If Cadwolloper is going to learn poetry, I\r\nwill, too," he grinned. "Mama! it\'ll be good as a three-ringed circus!\r\nI never thought uh that, before. I couldn\'t miss it."', '"Oh, well, if you fellows take a hand, I\'ll sure have to be there to\r\nsee," Andy decided. "Two o\'clock, did she say?"', '"I hate to be called a quitter," Pink remarked dispiritedly to the\r\nHappy Family in general; a harassed looking Happy Family, which sat\r\naround and said little, and watched the clock. In an hour they would\r\nbe due to attend the second meeting of the M.I.S.S.—and one would\r\nthink, from the look of them, that they were about to be hanged. "I\r\nhate to be called a quitter, but right here\'s where I lay \'em down.\r\nThe rest of yuh can go on being improved, if yuh want to—darned if I\r\nwill, though. I\'m all in."', '"I don\'t recollect hearing anybody say we wanted to," growled Jack\r\nBates. "Irish, maybe, is still burning with a desire to be nice and\r\nchivalrous; but you can count me out. One dose is about all I can\r\nstand."', '"By golly, I wouldn\'t go and feel that foolish again, not if yuh paid\r\nme for it," Slim declared.', 'Irish grinned and reached for his hat. "I done my damnettest," he said\r\ncheerfully. "I made the old girl happy once; now, one Irish Mallory is\r\ndue to have a little joy coming his way. I\'m going to town."', '"\'Break, break, break, on thy cold, gray crags, oh sea,\r\nAnd I would that my tongue could utter the thoughts that come over me.\'', '"You will observe, gentlemen, the beautiful sentiment, the euphonious\r\nrhythm, the noble—" Weary went down, still declaiming mincingly,\r\nbeneath four irate bodies that hurled themselves toward him and upon\r\nhim.', '"We\'ll break, break, break every bone in your body if you don\'t shut\r\nup. You will observe the beautiful sentiment of that a while," cried\r\nPink viciously. "I\'ve had the euphonious rhythm of my sleep broke up\r\never since I set there and listened at her for two hours. Josephine!"', 'Irish stopped with his hand on the door knob. "I was the jay that\r\nstarted it," he admitted contritely. "But, honest, I never had a hunch\r\nshe was plumb locoed; I thought she was just simply foolish. Come on\r\nto town, boys!"', 'Such is the power of suggestion that in fifteen minutes the Happy\r\nFamily had passed out of sight over the top of the grade; all save\r\nAndy Green, who told them he would be along after a while, and that\r\nthey need not wait. He looked at the clock, smoked a meditative\r\ncigarette and went up to the White House, to attend the second meeting\r\nof the Mutual Improvement and Social Society.', "When he faced alone Miss Verbena Martin, and explained that the other\r\nmembers were unavoidably absent because they had a grudge against a\r\nman in Dry Lake and had gone in to lynch him and burn the town, Miss\r\nMartin was shocked into postponing the meeting. Andy said he was glad,\r\nbecause he wanted to go in and see the fight; undoubtedly, he assured\r\nher, there would be a fight, and probably a few of them would get\r\nkilled off. He reminded her that he had told her right in the start\r\nthat they were a bad lot, and that she would have hard work reforming\r\nthem; and finally, he made her promise that she would not mention to\r\nanyone what he had told her, because it wouldn't be safe for him, or\r\nfor her, if they ever got to hear of it. After that Andy also took the\r\ntrail to town, and he went at a gallop and smiled as he rode.", 'Miss Martin reflected shudderingly upon the awful details of the\r\ncrime, as hinted at by Andy, and packed her trunk. It might be brave\r\nand noble to stay and work among all those savages, but she doubted\r\nmuch whether it were after all her duty. She thought of many ways in\r\nwhich she could do more real good nearer home. She had felt all along\r\nthat these cowboys were an untrustworthy lot; she had noticed them\r\nglancing at one another in a secret and treacherous manner, all\r\nthrough the last meeting, and she was positive they had not given her\r\nthat full confidence without which no good can be accomplished. That\r\nfellow they called Happy looked capable of almost any crime; she had\r\nnever felt quite safe in his presence.', 'Miss Martin pictured them howling and dancing around the burning\r\ndwellings of their enemies, shooting every one they could see; Miss\r\nMartin had imagination, of a sort. But while she pictured the horrors\r\nof an Indian massacre she continued to pack her suit-case and to\r\nconsult often her watch. When she could do no more it occurred to her\r\nthat she would better see if someone could take her to the station.\r\nFortunately for all concerned, somebody could. One might go further\r\nand say that somebody was quite willing to strain a point, even, in\r\norder to get her there in time for the next train.', "The Happy Family was gathered in Rusty Brown's place, watching Irish\r\ndo things to a sheep-man from Lonesome Prairie, in a game of pool.\r\nThey were just giving vent to a prolonged whoop of derision at the\r\nsheep-man's play, when a rig flashed by the window. Weary stopped with\r\nhis mouth wide open and stared; leaned to the window and craned to see\r\nmore clearly.", '"Mama mine!" he ejaculated incredulously. "I could swear I saw Miss\r\nVerbena in that rig, with her trunk, and headed towards the depot.\r\nFeel my pulse, Cadwolloper, and see if I\'m normal."', 'But Pink was on his way to the back door, and from there climbed like\r\na cat to the roof of the coal-house, where, as he knew from\r\nexperience, one could see the trail to the depot, and the depot\r\nitself.', '"It\'s sure her," he announced. "Chip\'s driving like hell, and the\r\nsmoke uh the train\'s just coming around the bend from the big field.\r\nWonder what struck her so sudden?" He turned and looked down into the\r\ngrinning face of Andy Green.', '"She was real insulted because you fellows played hookey," Andy\r\nexplained. "I tried to explain, but it didn\'t help none. I don\'t\r\nbelieve her heart went out to us like she claimed, anyhow."', 'Happy Jack, over on the Shonkin range, saw how far it was to the river\r\nand mopped the heat-crimsoned face of him with a handkerchief not\r\nquite as clean as it might have been. He hoped that the Flying U\r\nwagons would be where he had estimated that they would be; for he was\r\naweary of riding with a strange outfit, where his little personal\r\npeculiarities failed to meet with that large tolerance accorded by the\r\nHappy Family. He didn\'t think much of the Shonkin crew; grangers and\r\npilgrims, he called them disgustedly in his mind. He hoped the Old Man\r\nwould not send him on that long trip with them south of the\r\nHighwoods—which is what he was on his way to find out about. What\r\nHappy Jack was hoping for, was to have the Old Man—as represented by\r\nChip—send one of the boys back with him to bring over what Flying U\r\ncattle had been gathered, together with Happy\'s bed and string of\r\nhorses. Then he would ride with the Happy Family on the familiar\r\nrange that was better, in his eyes, than any other range that ever\r\nlay outdoors—and the Shonkin outfit could go to granny. (Happy did\r\nnot, however, say "granny").', "He turned down the head of a coulee which promised to lead him, by the\r\nmost direct route—if any route in the Badlands can be called\r\ndirect—to the river, across which, and a few miles up on Suction\r\nCreek, he confidently expected to find the Flying U wagons. The coulee\r\nwound aimlessly, with precipitous sides that he could not climb, even\r\nby leading his horse. Happy Jack, under the sweltering heat of\r\nmid-June sunlight, once more mopped his face, now more crimson than\r\never, and relapsed into his habitual gloom. Just when he was telling\r\nhimself pessimistically that the chances were he would run slap out on\r\na cut bank where he couldn't get down to the river at all, the coulee\r\nturned again and showed the gray-blue water slithering coolly past,\r\nwith the far bank green and sloping invitingly.", 'The horse hurried forward at a shuffling trot and thrust his hot\r\nmuzzle into the delicious coolness. Happy Jack slipped off and, lying\r\nflat on his stomach, up-stream from the horse, drank deep and long,\r\nthen stood up, wiped his face and considered the necessity of\r\ncrossing. Just at this point the river was not so wide as in others,\r\nand for that reason the current flowed swiftly past. Not too swiftly,\r\nhowever, if one took certain precautions. Happy Jack measured mentally\r\nthe strength of the current and the proper amount of caution which it\r\nwould be expedient to use, and began his preparations; for the sun was\r\nsliding down hill toward the western skyline, and he wished very much\r\nto reach the wagons in time for supper, if he could.', 'Standing in the shade of the coulee wall, he undressed deliberately,\r\nfolding each garment methodically as he took it off. When the pile was\r\ncomplete to socks and boots, he rolled it into a compact bundle and\r\ntied it firmly upon his saddle. Stranger, his horse, was a good\r\nswimmer, and always swam high out of water. He hoped the things would\r\nnot get very wet; still, the current was strong, and his\r\ncharacteristic pessimism suggested that they would be soaked to the\r\nlast thread. So, naked as our first ancestor, he urged his horse into\r\nthe stream, and when it was too deep for kicking—Stranger was ever\r\nuncertain and not to be trusted too far—he caught him firmly by the\r\ntail and felt the current grip them both. The feel of the water was\r\nglorious after so long a ride in the hot sun, and Happy Jack reveled\r\nin the cool swash of it up his shoulders to the back of his neck, as\r\nStranger swam out and across to the sloping, green bank on the home\r\nside. When his feet struck bottom, Happy Jack should have waded\r\nalso—but the water was so deliciously cool, slapping high up on his\r\nshoulders like that; he still floated luxuriously, towed by\r\nStranger—until Stranger, his footing secure, glanced back at Happy\r\nsliding behind like a big, red fish, snorted and plunged up and on to\r\ndry land.', 'Happy Jack struck his feet down to bottom, stumbled and let go his\r\nhold of the tail, and Stranger, feeling the weight loosen suddenly,\r\ngave another plunge and went careering up the bank, snorting back at\r\nHappy Jack. Happy swore, waded out and made threats, but Stranger,\r\nseeing himself pursued by a strange figure whose only resemblance to\r\nhis master lay in voice and profanity, fled in terror before him.', 'Happy Jack, crippling painfully on the stones, fled fruitlessly after,\r\nstill shouting threats. Then, as Stranger, galloping wildly,\r\ndisappeared over a ridge, he stood and stared stupidly at the place\r\nwhere the horse had last been seen. For the moment his mind refused to\r\ngrasp all the horror of his position; he stepped gingerly over the hot\r\nsand and rocks, sought the shelter of a bit of overhanging bank, and\r\nsat dazedly down upon a rock too warm for comfort. He shifted uneasily\r\nto the sand beside, found that still hotter, and returned to the rock.', 'He needed to think; to grasp this disaster that had come so suddenly\r\nupon him. He looked moodily across to the southern bank, his chin\r\nsunken between moist palms, the while the water dried upon his person.\r\nTo be set afoot, down here in the Badlands, away from the habitations\r\nof men and fifteen miles from the probable location of the Flying U\r\ncamp, was not nice. To be set afoot naked—it was horrible, and\r\nunbelievable. He thought of tramping, barefooted and bare-legged,\r\nthrough fifteen miles of sage-covered Badlands to camp, with the sun\r\nbeating down on his unprotected back, and groaned in anticipation. Not\r\neven his pessimism had ever pictured a thing so terrible.', "He gazed at the gray-blue river which had caused this trouble that he\r\nmust face, and forgetting the luxury of its coolness, cursed it\r\nvenomously. Little waves washed up on the pebbly bank, and glinted in\r\nthe sun while they whispered mocking things to him. Happy Jack gave\r\nover swearing at the river, and turned his wrath upon\r\nStranger—Stranger, hurtling along somewhere through the breaks, with\r\nall Happy's clothes tied firmly to the saddle. Happy Jack sighed\r\nlugubriously when he remembered how firmly. A fleeting hope that, if\r\nhe followed the trail of Stranger, he might glean a garment or two\r\nthat had slipped loose, died almost before it lived. Happy Jack knew\r\ntoo well the kind of knots he always tied. His favorite boast that\r\nnothing ever worked loose on his saddle, came back now to mock him\r\nwith its absolute truth.", 'The sun, dropping a bit lower, robbed him inch by inch of the shade to\r\nwhich he clung foolishly. He hunched himself into as small a space as\r\nhis big frame would permit, and hung his hat upon his knees where they\r\nstuck out into the sunlight. It was very hot, and his position was\r\ncramped, but he would not go yet; he was still thinking—and the brain\r\nof Happy Jack worked ever slowly. In such an unheard-of predicament\r\nhe felt dimly that he had need of much thought.', 'When not even his hat could shield him from the sun glare, he got up\r\nand went nipping awkwardly over the hot beach. He was going into the\r\nnext river-bottom—wherever that was—on the chance of finding a\r\ncow-camp, or some cabin where he could, by some means, clothe himself.\r\nHe did not like the idea of facing the Happy Family in his present\r\ncondition; he knew the Happy Family. Perhaps he might find someone\r\nliving down here next the river. He hoped so—for Happy Jack, when\r\nthings were so bad they could not well be worse, was forced to give\r\nover the prediction of further evil, and pursue blindly the faintest\r\nwhisper of hope. He got up on the bank, where the grass was kinder to\r\nhis unaccustomed feet than were the hot stones below, and hurried away\r\nwith his back to the sun, that scorched him cruelly.', 'In the next bottom—and he was long getting to it—the sage brush grew\r\ndishearteningly thick. Happy began to be afraid of snakes. He went\r\nslowly, stepping painfully where the ground seemed smoothest; he never\r\ncould walk fifteen miles in his bare feet, he owned dismally to\r\nhimself. His only hope lay in getting clothes.', 'Halfway down the bottom, he joyfully came upon a camp, but it had long\r\nbeen deserted; from the low, tumble-down corrals, and the unmistakable\r\natmosphere of the place, Happy Jack knew it for a sheep camp. But\r\nnothing save the musty odor and the bare cabin walls seemed to have\r\nbeen left behind. He searched gloomily, thankful for the brief shade\r\nthe cabin offered. Then, tossed up on the rafters and forgotten, he\r\ndiscovered a couple of dried sheep pelts, untanned and stiff, almost,\r\nas shingles. Still, they were better than nothing, and he grinned in\r\nsickly fashion at the find.', 'Realizing, in much pain, that some protection for his feet was an\r\nabsolute necessity, he tore a pelt in two for sandals. Much search\r\nresulted in the discovery of a bit of rotted rope, which he unraveled\r\nand thereby bound a piece of sheepskin upon each bruised foot. They\r\nwere not pretty, but they answered the purpose. The other pelt he\r\ndisposed of easily by tying the two front legs together around his\r\nneck and letting the pelt hang down his back as far as it would reach.\r\nThere being nothing more that he could do in the way of\r\nself-adornment, Happy Jack went out again into the hot afternoon. At\r\nhis best, Happy Jack could never truthfully be called handsome; just\r\nnow, clothed inadequately in gray Stetson hat and two meager\r\nsheepskins, he looked scarce human.', 'Cheered a bit, he set out sturdily over the hills toward the mouth of\r\nSuction Creek. The Happy Family would make all kinds of fools of\r\nthemselves, he supposed, if he showed up like this; but he might not\r\nbe obliged to appear before them in his present state of undress; he\r\nmight strike some other camp, first. Happy Jack was still forced to be\r\nhopeful. He quite counted on striking another camp before reaching the\r\nwagons of the Flying U.', "The sun slid farther and farther toward the western rim of tumbled\r\nridges as Happy Jack, in his strange raiment, plodded laboriously to\r\nthe north. The mantle he was forced to shift constantly into a new\r\nposition as the sun's rays burned deep a new place, or the stiff hide\r\ngalled his blistered shoulders. The sandals did better, except that\r\nthe rotten strands of rope were continually wearing through on the\r\nbottom, so that he must stop and tie fresh knots, or replace the bit\r\nfrom the scant surplus which he had prudently brought along.", 'Till sundown he climbed toilfully up the steep hills and then\r\nscrambled as toilfully into the coulees, taking the straightest course\r\nhe knew for the mouth of Suction Creek; that, as a last resort, while\r\nhe watched keenly for the white flake against green which would tell\r\nof a tent pitched there in the wilderness. He was hungry—when he\r\nforgot other discomforts long enough to think of it. Worst, perhaps,\r\nwas the way in which the gaunt sage brush scratched his unclothed legs\r\nwhen he was compelled to cross a patch on some coulee bottom. Happy\r\nJack swore a great deal, in those long, heat-laden hours, and never\r\ndid he so completely belie the name men had in sarcasm given him.', 'Just when he was given over to the most gloomy forebodings, a white\r\nsquare stood out for a moment sharply against a background of pines,\r\nfar below him in a coulee where the sun was peering fleetingly before\r\nit dove out of sight over a hill. Happy Jack—of a truth, the most\r\nunhappy Jack one could find, though he searched far and long—stood\r\nstill and eyed the white patch critically. There was only the one; but\r\nanother might be hidden in the trees. Still, there was no herd grazing\r\nanywhere in the coulee, and no jingle of cavvy bells came to his\r\nears, though he listened long. He was sure that it was not the camp of\r\nthe Flying U, where he would be ministered unto faithfully, to be\r\nsure, yet where the ministrations would be mingled with much\r\nwit-sharpened raillery harder even to bear than was his present\r\ncondition of sun-blisters and scratches. He thanked the Lord in\r\nsincere if unorthodox terms, and went down the hill in long,\r\nungraceful strides.', 'It was far down that hill, and it was farther across the coulee. Each\r\nstep grew more wearisome to Happy Jack, unaccustomed as he was to\r\nusing his own feet as a mode of travel. But away in the edge of the\r\npine grove were food and raiment, and a shelter from the night that\r\nwas creeping down on him with the hurried stealth of a mountain lion\r\nafter its quarry. He shifted the sheepskin mantle for the thousandth\r\ntime; this time he untied it from his galled shoulders and festooned\r\nit modestly if unbecomingly about his middle.', "Feeling sure of the unfailing hospitality of the rangeland, be the\r\ntent-dweller whom he might, Happy Jack walked boldly through the soft,\r\nspring twilight that lasts long in Montana, and up to the very door of\r\nthe tent. A figure—a female figure—slender and topped by thin face\r\nand eyes sheltered behind glasses, rose up, gazed upon him in horror,\r\nshrieked till one could hear her a mile, and fell backward into the\r\ntent. Another female figure appeared, looked, and shrieked also—and\r\neven louder than did the first. Happy Jack, with a squawk of dismay,\r\nturned and flew incontinently afar into the dusk. A man's voice he\r\nheard, shouting inquiry; another, shouting what, from a distance,\r\nsounded like threats. Happy Jack did not wait to make sure; he ran\r\nblindly, until he brought up in a patch of prickly-pear, at which he\r\nyelled, forgetting for the instant that he was pursued. Somehow he\r\nfloundered out and away from the torture of the stinging spines, and\r\ntook to the hills. A moon, big as the mouth of a barrel, climbed over\r\na ridge and betrayed him to the men searching below, and they shouted\r\nand fired a gun. Happy Jack did not believe they could shoot very\r\nstraight, but he was in no mood to take chances; he sought refuge\r\namong a jumble of great, gray bowlders; sat himself down in the shadow\r\nand caressed gingerly the places where the prickly-pear had punctured\r\nhis skin, and gave himself riotously over to blasphemy.", 'The men below were prowling half-heartedly, it seemed to him—as if\r\nthey were afraid of running upon him too suddenly. It came to him that\r\nthey were afraid of him—and he grinned feebly at the joke. He had not\r\nbefore stopped to consider his appearance, being concerned with more\r\nimportant matters. Now, however, as he pulled the scant covering of\r\nthe pelt over his shoulders to keep off the chill of the night, he\r\ncould not wonder that the woman at the tent had fainted. Happy Jack\r\nsuspected shrewdly that he could, in that rig, startle almost any one.', 'He watched the coulee wistfully. They were making fires, down there\r\nbelow him; great, revealing bonfires at intervals that would make it\r\nimpossible to pass their line unseen. He could not doubt that some one\r\nwas cached in the shadows with a gun. There were more than two men;\r\nHappy Jack thought that there must be at least four or five. He would\r\nhave liked to go down, just out of gun range, and shout explanations\r\nand a request for some clothes—only for the women. Happy was always\r\nill at ease in the presence of strange women, and he felt, just now,\r\nquite unequal to the ordeal of facing those two. He sat huddled in\r\nthe shadow of a rock and wished profanely that women would stay at\r\nhome and not go camping out in the Badlands, where their presence was\r\ndistinctly inappropriate and undesirable. If the men down there were\r\nalone, he felt sure that he could make them understand. Seeing they\r\nwere not alone, however, he stayed where he was and watched the fires,\r\nwhile his teeth chattered with cold and his stomach ached with the\r\nhunger he could not appease.', 'Till daylight he sat there unhappily and watched the unwinking\r\nchallenge of the flames below, and miserably wished himself elsewhere;\r\neven the jibes of the Happy Family would be endurable, so long as he\r\nhad the comfort afforded by the Flying U camp. But that was miles\r\naway. And when daylight brought warmth and returning courage, he went\r\nso far as to wish the Flying U camp farther away than it probably was.\r\nHe wanted to get somewhere, and ask help from strangers rather than\r\nthose he knew best.', 'With that idea fixed in his mind, he got stiffly to his bruised feet,\r\nreadjusted the sheepskin and began wearily to climb higher. When the\r\nsun tinged all the hilltops golden yellow, he turned and shook his\r\nfist impotently at the camp far beneath him. Then he went on doggedly.', 'Standing at last on a high peak, he looked away toward the sunrise and\r\nmade out a white speck on a grassy side-hill; beside it, a gray square\r\nmoved slowly over the green. Sheep, and a sheep camp—and Happy Jack,\r\nhater of sheep though he was, hailed the sight as a bit of rare good\r\nluck. His spirits rose immediately, and he started straight for the\r\nplace.', 'Down in the next coulee—there were always coulees to cross, no matter\r\nin what direction one would travel—he came near running plump into\r\nthree riders, who were Irish Mallory, and Weary, and Pink. They were\r\nriding down from the direction of the camp where were the women, and\r\nthey caught sight of him immediately and gave chase. Happy Jack had no\r\nmind to be rounded up by that trio; he dodged into the bushes, and\r\nthough they dug long, unmerciful scratches in his person, clung to the\r\nshelter they gave and made off at top speed. He could hear the others\r\nshouting at one another as they galloped here and there trying to\r\nlocate him, and he skulked where the bushes were deepest, like a\r\ncriminal in fear of lynching.', 'Luck, for once, was with him, and he got out into another\r\nbrush-fringed coulee without being seen, and felt himself, for the\r\npresent, safe from that portion of the Happy Family. Thereafter he\r\navoided religiously the higher ridges, and kept the direction more by\r\ninstinct than by actual knowledge. The sun grew hot again and he\r\nhurried on, shifting the sheepskin as the need impressed.', 'When at last he sighted again the sheep, they were very close. Happy\r\nJack grew cautious; he crept down upon the unsuspecting herder as\r\nstealthily as an animal hunting its breakfast. Herders sometimes carry\r\nguns—and the experience of last night burned hot in his memory.', 'Slipping warily from rock to rock, he was within a dozen feet, when a\r\ndog barked and betrayed his presence. The herder did not have a gun.\r\nHe gave a yell of pure terror and started for camp after his weapon.\r\nHappy Jack, yelling also, with long leaps followed after. Twice the\r\nherder looked over his shoulder at the weird figure in gray hat and\r\nflapping sheepskin, and immediately after each glance his pace\r\nincreased perceptibly. Still Happy Jack, desperate beyond measure,\r\ndoggedly pursued, and his long legs lessened at each jump the\r\ndistance between. From a spectacular viewpoint, it must have been a\r\npretty race.', 'The herder, with a gasp, dove into the tent; into the tent Happy Jack\r\ndove after him—and none too soon. The hand of the herder had almost\r\nclasped his rifle when the weight of Happy bore him shrieking to the\r\nearthen floor.', '"Aw, yuh locoed old fool, shut up, can\'t yuh, a minute?" Happy Jack,\r\nwith his fingers pressed against the windpipe of the other, had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing his request granted at once. The shrieks died\r\nto mere gurgling. "What I want uh you," Happy went on crossly,\r\n"ain\'t your lifeblood, yuh dam\' Swede idiot. I want some clothes, and\r\nsome grub; and I want to borry that pinto I seen picketed out in the\r\nhollow, down there. Now, will yuh let up that yelling and act white,\r\nor must I pound some p\'liteness into yuh? Say!"', '"By damn, Ay tank yo\' vas got soom crazy," apologized the herder\r\nhumbly, sanity growing in his pale blue eyes. "Ay tank—"', '"Oh, I don\'t give a cuss what you tank," Happy Jack cut in. "I ain\'t\r\nhad anything to eat sence yesterday forenoon, and I ain\'t had any\r\nclothes on sence yesterday, either. Send them darn dogs back to watch\r\nyour sheep, and get busy with breakfast! I\'ve got a lot to do, t\'-day.\r\nI\'ve got to round up my horse and get my clothes that\'s tied to the\r\nsaddle, and get t\' where I\'m going. Get up, darn yuh! I ain\'t going t\'\r\neat yuh—not unless you\'re too slow with that grub."', 'The herder was submissive and placating, and permitted Happy Jack to\r\nappropriate the conventional garb of a male human, the while coffee\r\nand bacon were maddening his hunger with their tantalizing odor. He\r\nseemed much more at ease, once he saw that Happy Jack, properly\r\nclothed, was not particularly fearsome to look upon, and talked\r\nvolubly while he got out bread and stewed prunes and boiled beans for\r\nthe thrice-unexpected guest.', 'Happy Jack, clothed and fed, became himself again and prophesied\r\ngloomily: "The chances is, that horse uh mine\'ll be forty miles away\r\nand still going, by this time; but soon as I can round him up, I\'ll\r\nbring your pinto back. Yuh needn\'t t\' worry none; I guess I got all\r\nthe sense I\'ve ever had."', "Once more astride a horse—albeit the pinto pony of a\r\nsheepherder—Happy Jack felt abundantly able to cope with the\r\nsituation. He made a detour that put him far from where the three he\r\nmost dreaded to meet were apt to be, and struck out at the pinto's\r\nbest pace for the river at the point where he had crossed so\r\ndisastrously the day before.", "Having a good memory for directions and localities, he easily found\r\nthe place of unhappy memory; and taking up Stranger's trail through\r\nthe sand from there, he got the general direction of his flight and\r\nfollowed vengefully after; rode for an hour up a long, grassy coulee,\r\nand came suddenly upon the fugitive feeding quietly beside a spring.\r\nThe bundle of clothing was still tied firmly to the saddle, and at\r\nsight of it the face of Happy Jack relaxed somewhat from its gloom.", 'When Happy rode up and cast a loop over his head Stranger nickered a\r\nbit, as if he did not much enjoy freedom while he yet bore the\r\ntrappings of servitude. And his submission was so instant and\r\nvoluntary that Happy Jack had not the heart to do as he had threatened\r\nmany times in the last few hours—"to beat the hide off him." Instead,\r\nhe got hastily into his clothes—quite as if he feared they might\r\nagain be whisked away from him—and then rubbed forgivingly the nose\r\nof Stranger, and solicitously pulled a few strands of his forelock\r\nfrom under the brow-band. In the heart of Happy Jack was a great\r\npeace, marred only by the physical discomforts of much sun-blister and\r\nmany deep scratches. After that he got thankfully into his own saddle\r\nand rode gladly away, leading the pinto pony behind him. He had got\r\nout of the scrape, and the Happy Family would never find it out; it\r\nwas not likely that they would chance upon the Swede herder, or if\r\nthey did, that they would exchange with him many words. The Happy\r\nFamily held itself physically, mentally, morally and socially far\r\nabove sheepherders—and in that lay the safety of Happy Jack.', "It was nearly noon when he reached again the sheep camp, and the Swede\r\nhospitably urged him to stay and eat with him; but Happy Jack would\r\nnot tarry, for he was anxious to reach the camp of the Flying U. A\r\nmile from the herder's camp he saw again on a distant hilltop three\r\nfamiliar figures. This time he did not dodge into shelter, but urged\r\nStranger to a gallop and rode boldly toward them. They greeted him\r\njoyfully and at the top of their voices when he came within shouting\r\ndistance.", '"How comes it you\'re riding the pinnacles over here?" Weary wanted to\r\nknow, as soon as he rode alongside.', '"Aw, I just came over after more orders; hope they send somebody else\r\nover there, if they want any more repping done," Happy Jack said, in\r\nhis customary tone of discontent with circumstances.', '"Say! Yuh didn\'t see anything of a wild man, down next the river, did\r\nyuh?" put in Pink.', '"Aw, gwan! what wild man?" Happy Jack eyed them suspiciously.', '"Honest, there\'s a wild man ranging around here in these hills," Pink\r\ndeclared. "We\'ve been mooching around all forenoon, hunting him. Got\r\nsight of him, early this morning, but he got away in the brush."', 'Happy Jack looked guilty, and even more suspicious. Was it possible\r\nthat they had recognized him?', '"The way we come to hear about him," Weary explained, "we happened\r\nacross some campers, over in a little coulee to the west uh here. They\r\nwas all worked up over him. Seems he went into camp last night, and\r\nlike to scared the ladies into fits. He ain\'t got enough clothes on to\r\nflag an antelope, according to them, and he\'s about seven feet high,\r\nand looks more like a missing link than a plain, ordinary man. The\r\none that didn\'t faint away got the best look at him, and she\'s ready\r\nto take oath he ain\'t more\'n half human. They kept fires burning all\r\nnight to scare him out uh the coulee, and they\'re going to break camp\r\nto-day and hike for home. They say he give a screech that\'d put a\r\ncrimp in the devil himself, and went galloping off, jumping about\r\ntwenty feet at a lick. And—"', '"Aw, gwan!" protested Happy Jack, feebly.', '"So help me Josephine, it\'s the truth," abetted Pink, round-eyed and\r\nunmistakably in earnest. "We wouldn\'t uh taken much stock in it,\r\neither, only we saw him ourselves, not more than two hundred yards\r\noff. He was just over the hill from the coulee where they were camped,\r\nso it\'s bound to be the same animal. It\'s a fact, he didn\'t have much\r\ncovering—just something hung over his shoulders. And he was sure\r\nwild, for soon as he seen us he humped himself and got into the brush.\r\nWe could hear him go crashing away like a whole bunch of elephants.\r\nIt\'s a damn\' shame he got away on us," Pink sighed regretfully. "We\r\nwas going to rope him and put him in a cage; we could sure uh made\r\nmoney on him, at two bits a look."', 'Happy Jack continued to eye the three distrustfully. Too often had he\r\nbeen the victim of their humor for him now to believe implicitly in\r\ntheir ignorance. It was too good to be real, it seemed to him. Still,\r\nif by any good luck it were real, he hated to think what would\r\nhappen if they ever found out the truth. He eased the clothing\r\ncautiously away from his smarting back, and stared hard into a coulee.', '"It was likely some sheepherder gone clean nutty," mused Irish.', '"Well, the most uh them wouldn\'t have far to go," ventured Happy Jack,\r\nthinking of the Swede.', '"What we ought to do," said Pink, keen for the chase, "is for the\r\nwhole bunch of us to come down here and round him up. Wonder if we\r\ncouldn\'t talk Chip into laying off for a day or so; there\'s no herd to\r\nhold. I sure would like to get a good look at him."', '"Somebody ought to take him in," observed Irish longingly. "He ain\'t\r\nsafe, running around loose like that. There\'s no telling what he might\r\ndo. The way them campers read his brand, he\'s plumb dangerous to meet\r\nup with alone. It\'s lucky you didn\'t run onto him, Happy."', '"Well, I didn\'t," growled Happy Jack. "And what\'s more, I betche\r\nthere ain\'t any such person."', '"Don\'t call us liars to our faces, Happy," Weary reproved. "We told\r\nyuh, a dozen times, that we saw him ourselves. Yuh might be polite\r\nenough to take our word for it."', '"Aw, gwan!" Happy Jack grunted, still not quite sure of how much—or\r\nhow little—they knew. While they discussed further the wild man, he\r\nwatched furtively for the surreptitious lowering of lids that would\r\nbetray their insincerity. When they appealed to him for an opinion of\r\nsome phase of the subject, he answered with caution. He tried to turn\r\nthe talk to his experiences on the Shonkin range, and found the wild\r\nman cropping up with disheartening persistency. He shifted often in\r\nthe saddle, because of the deep sunburns which smarted continually and\r\nmaddeningly. He wondered if the boys had used all of that big box of\r\ncarbolic salve which used to be kept in a corner of the mess-box; and\r\nwas carbolic salve good for sun-blisters? He told himself gloomily\r\nthat if there was any of it left, and if it were good for his ailment,\r\nthere wouldn\'t be half enough of it, anyway. He estimated unhappily\r\nthat he would need about two quarts.', "When they reached camp, the welcome of Happy Jack was overshadowed and\r\nmade insignificant by the strange story of the wild man. Happy Jack,\r\nmentally and physically miserable, was forced to hear it all told over\r\nagain, and to listen to the excited comments of the others. He was\r\nsick of the subject. He had heard enough about the wild man, and he\r\nwished fervently that they would shut up about it. He couldn't see\r\nthat it was anything to make such a fuss about, anyway. And he wished\r\nhe could get his hands on that carbolic salve, without having the\r\nwhole bunch rubbering around and asking questions about something that\r\nwas none of their business. He even wished, in that first bitter hour\r\nafter he had eaten and while they were lying idly in the shady spots,\r\nthat he was back on the Shonkin range with an alien crew.", 'It was perhaps an hour later that Pink, always of an investigative\r\nturn of mind, came slipping quietly up through the rose bushes from\r\nthe creek. The Happy Family, lying luxuriously upon the grass, were\r\nstill discussing the latest excitement. Pink watched his chance and\r\nwhen none but Weary observed him jerked his head mysteriously toward\r\nthe creek.', 'Weary got up, yawned ostentatiously, and sauntered away in the wake of\r\nPink. "What\'s the matter, Cadwolloper?" he asked, when he was close\r\nenough. "Seen a garter snake?" Pink was notoriously afraid of snakes.', '"You come with me, and I\'ll show yuh the wild man," he grinned.', '"Mama!" ejaculated Weary, and followed stealthily where Pink led.', 'Some distance up the creek Pink signalled caution, and they crept like\r\nIndians on hands and knees through the grass. On the edge of the high\r\nbank they stopped, and Pink motioned. Weary looked over and came near\r\nwhooping at the sight below. He gazed a minute, drew back and put his\r\nface close to the face of Pink.', '"Cadwolloper, go get the bunch!" he commanded in a whisper, and Pink,\r\nagain signalling needlessly for silence, slipped hastily away from the\r\nspot.', 'Happy Jack, secure in the seclusion offered by the high bank of the\r\ncreek, ran his finger regretfully around the inside of the carbolic\r\nsalve box, eyed the result dissatisfiedly, and applied the finger\r\ncarefully to a deep cut on his knee. He had got that cut while going\r\nup the bluff, just after leaving the tent where had been the shrieking\r\nfemales. He wished there was more salve, and he picked up the cover of\r\nthe box and painstakingly wiped out the inside; the result was\r\ndisheartening.', 'He examined his knee dolefully. It was beginning to look inflamed, and\r\nit was going to make him limp. He wondered if the boys would notice\r\nanything queer about his walk. If they did, there was the conventional\r\nexcuse that his horse had fallen down with him—Happy Jack hoped that\r\nit would be convincing. He took up the box again and looked at the\r\nshining emptiness of it. It had been half full—not enough, by a long\r\nway—and maybe some one would wonder what had become of it. Darn a\r\nbunch that always had to know everything, anyway!', 'Happy Jack, warned at last by that unnamed instinct which tells of a\r\npresence unseen, turned around and looked up apprehensively. The Happy\r\nFamily, sitting in a row upon their heels on the bank, looked down at\r\nhim gravely and appreciatively.', '"There\'s a can uh wagon dope, up at camp," Cal Emmett informed him\r\nsympathetically.', '"Aw—" Happy Jack began, and choked upon his humiliation.', '"I used to know a piece uh poetry about a fellow like Happy," Weary\r\nremarked sweetly. "It said', "'He raised his veil, the maid turned slowly round\nLooked at him, shrieked, and fell upon the ground.'", 'Only, in this case," Weary smiled blandly down upon him, "Happy didn\'t\r\nhave no veil."', '"Aw, gwan!" adjured Happy Jack helplessly, and reached for his\r\nclothes, while the Happy Family chorused a demand for explanations.', 'When the days grow crisp at each end and languorous in the middle;\r\nwhen a haze ripples the skyline like a waving ribbon of faded blue;\r\nwhen the winds and the grasses stop and listen for the first on-rush\r\nof winter, then it is that the rangeland takes on a certain\r\nintoxicating unreality, and range-wild blood leaps with desire to do\r\nsomething—anything, so it is different and irresponsible and not\r\nmeasured by precedent or prudence.', "In days like that one grows venturesome and ignores difficulties and\r\nlimitations with a fine disregard for probable consequences, a mental\r\nsnapping of fingers. On a day like that, the Happy Family, riding\r\ntogether out of Dry Lake with the latest news in mind and speech,\r\nurged Andy Green, tamer of wild ones, to enter the rough-riding\r\ncontest exploited as one of the features of the Northern Montana Fair,\r\nto be held at Great Falls in two weeks. Pink could not enter, because\r\na horse had fallen with him and hurt his leg, so that he was picking\r\nthe gentlest in his string for daily riding. Weary would not, because\r\nhe had promised his Little Schoolma'am to take care of himself and not\r\ntake any useless risks; even the temptation of a two-hundred-dollar\r\npurse could not persuade him that a rough-riding contest is perfectly\r\nsafe and without the ban. But Andy, impelled by the leaping blood of\r\nhim and urged by the loyal Family, consented and said he'd try it a\r\nwhirl, anyway.", 'They had only ridden four or five miles when the decision was reached,\r\nand they straightway turned back and raced into Dry Lake again, so\r\nthat Andy might write the letter that clinched matters. Then, whooping\r\nwith the sheer exhilaration of living, and the exultation of being\r\nable to ride and whoop unhindered, they galloped back to camp and let\r\nthe news spread as it would. In a week all Chouteau County knew that\r\nAndy Green would ride for the purse, and nearly all Chouteau County\r\nbacked him with all the money it could command; certainly, all of it\r\nthat knew Andy Green and had seen him ride, made haste to find someone\r\nwho did not know him and whose faith in another contestant was strong,\r\nand to bet all the money it could lay hands upon.', 'For Andy was one of those mild-mannered men whose genius runs to\r\nriding horses which object violently to being ridden; one of those\r\nlucky fellows who never seems to get his neck broken, however much he\r\nmay jeopardize it; and, moreover, he was that rare genius, who can\r\nmake a "pretty" ride where other broncho-fighters resemble nothing so\r\nmuch as a scarecrow in a cyclone. Andy not only could ride—he could\r\nride gracefully. And the reason for that, not many knew: Andy, in the\r\nyears before he wandered to the range, had danced, in spangled tights,\r\nupon the broad rump of a big gray horse which galloped around a\r\nsaw-dust ring with the regularity of movement that suggested a\r\nmachine, while a sober-clothed man in the center cracked a whip and\r\nyelped commands. Andy had jumped through blazing hoops and over\r\nsagging bunting while he rode—and he was just a trifle ashamed of the\r\nfact. Also—though it does not particularly matter—he had, later in\r\nthe performance, gone hurtling around the big tent dressed in the garb\r\nof an ancient Roman and driving four deep-chested bays abreast. As has\r\nbeen explained, he never boasted of his circus experience; though his\r\ndays in spangled tights probably had much to do with the inimitable\r\ngrace of him in the saddle. The Happy Family felt to a man that Andy\r\nwould win the purse and add honor to the Flying U in the winning. They\r\nwere enthusiastic over the prospect and willing to bet all they had on\r\nthe outcome.', 'The Happy Family, together with the aliens who swelled the crew to\r\nround-up size, was foregathered at the largest Flying U corral,\r\nwatching a bunch of newly bought horses circle, with much snorting and\r\nkicking up of dust, inside the fence. It was the interval between\r\nbeef-and calf-roundups, and the witchery of Indian Summer held the\r\nrange-land in thrall.', "Andy, sizing up the bunch and the brands, lighted upon a rangy blue\r\nroan that he knew—or thought he knew, and the eyes of him brightened\r\nwith desire. If he could get that roan in his string, he told himself,\r\nhe could go to sleep in the saddle on night-guard; for an easier horse\r\nto ride he never had straddled. It was like sitting in grandma's pet\r\nrocking chair when that roan loosened his muscles for a long, tireless\r\ngallop over the prairie sod, and as a stayer Andy had never seen his\r\nequal. It was not his turn to choose, however, and he held his breath\r\nlest the rope of another should settle over the slatey-black ears\r\nahead of him.", 'Cal Emmett roped a plump little black and led him out, grinning\r\nsatisfaction; from the white saddle-marks back of the withers he knew\r\nhim for a "broke" horse, and he certainly was pretty to look at. Andy\r\ngave him but a fleeting glance.', 'Happy Jack spread his loop and climbed down from the fence, almost at\r\nAndy\'s elbow. It was his turn to choose. "I betche that there blue\r\nroan over there is a good one," he remarked. "I\'m going to tackle\r\nhim."', 'Andy took his cigarette from between his lips. "Yuh better hobble your\r\nstirrups, then," he discouraged artfully. "I know that roan a heap\r\nbetter than you do."', '"Aw, gwan!" Happy, nevertheless, hesitated. "He\'s got a kind eye in\r\nhis head; yuh can always go by a horse\'s eye."', '"Can yuh?" Andy smiled indifferently. "Go after him, then. And say,\r\nHappy: if yuh ride that blue roan for five successive minutes, I\'ll\r\ngive yuh fifty dollars. I knew that hoss down on the Musselshell; he\'s\r\ngot a record that\'d reach from here to Dry Lake and back." It was a\r\nbluff, pure and simple, born of his covetousness, but it had the\r\ndesired effect—or nearly so.', 'Happy fumbled his rope and eyed the roan. "Aw, I betche you\'re just\r\nlying," he hazarded; but, like many another, when he did strike the\r\ntruth he failed to recognize it. "I betche—"', '"All right, rope him out and climb on, if yuh don\'t believe me." The\r\ntone of Andy was tinged with injury. "There\'s fifty dollars—yes, by\r\ngracious, I\'ll give yuh a hundred dollars if yuh ride him for five\r\nminutes straight."', 'A conversation of that character, carried on near the top of two\r\nfull-lunged voices, never fails in the range land to bring an audience\r\nof every male human within hearing. All other conversations and\r\ninterests were immediately suspended, and a dozen men trotted up to\r\nsee what it was all about. Andy remained roosting upon the top rail,\r\nhis rope coiled loosely and dangling from one arm while he smoked\r\nimperturbably.', '"Oh, Happy was going to rope out a sure-enough bad one for his night\r\nhoss, and out uh the goodness uh my heart, I put him wise to what he\r\nwas going up against," he explained carelessly.', '"He acts like he has some thoughts uh doubting my word, so I just\r\noffered him a hundred dollars to ride him—that blue roan, over there\r\nnext that crooked post. GET a reserved seat right in front of the\r\ngrand stand where all the big acts take PLACE;" he sung out suddenly,\r\nin the regulation circus tone.\r\n"GET-a-seat-right-in-front-where-Happy-Jack-the-WILD-Man-rides-the-BUCKING-BRONCHO—Go\r\non, Happy. Don\'t keep the audience waiting. Aren\'t yuh going to earn\r\nthat hundred dollars?"', 'Happy Jack turned half a shade redder than was natural. "Aw, gwan. I\r\nnever said I was going to do no broncho-busting ack. But I betche yuh\r\nnever seen that roan before he was unloaded in Dry Lake."', '"What\'ll yuh bet I don\'t know that hoss from a yearling colt?" Andy\r\nchallenged, and Happy Jack walked away without replying, and cast his\r\nloop sullenly over the first horse he came to—which was not the\r\nroan.', 'Chip, coming up to hear the last of it, turned and looked long at the\r\nhorse in question; a mild-mannered horse, standing by a crooked corral\r\npost and flicking his ears at the flies. "Do you know that roan?"he\r\nasked Andy, in the tone which brings truthful answer. Andy had one\r\ngood point: he never lied except in an irresponsible mood of pure\r\ndeviltry. For instance, he never had lied seriously, to an employer.', '"Sure, I know that hoss," he answered truthfully.', '"Did you ever ride him?"', '"No," Andy admitted, still truthfully. "I never rode him but once\r\nmyself, but I worked right with a Lazy 6 rep that had him in his\r\nstring, down at the U up-and-down, two years ago. I know the hoss, all\r\nright; but I did lie when I told Happy I knowed him from a colt. I\r\nspread it on a little bit thick, there." He smiled engagingly down at\r\nChip.', '"And he\'s a bad one, is he?" Chip queried Over his shoulder, just as\r\nhe was about to walk away.', '"Well," Andy prevaricated—still clinging to the letter, if not to the\r\nspirit of truth. "He ain\'t a hoss I\'d like to see Happy Jack go up\r\nagainst. I ain\'t saying, though, that he can\'t be rode. I don\'t say\r\nthat about any hoss."', '"Is he any worse than Glory, when Glory is feeling peevish?" Weary\r\nasked, when Chip was gone and while the men still lingered. Andy,\r\nglancing to make sure that Chip was out of hearing, threw away his\r\ncigarette and yielded to temptation. "Glory?" he snorted with a fine\r\ncontempt. "Why, Glory\'s—a—lamb beside that blue roan! Why, that\r\nhoss throwed Buckskin Jimmy clean out of a corral—Did yuh ever see\r\nBuckskin Jimmy ride? Well, say, yuh missed a pretty sight, then;\r\nJimmy\'s a sure-enough rider. About the only animal he ever failed to\r\nconnect with for keeps, is that same cow-backed hoss yuh see over\r\nthere. Happy says he\'s got a kind eye in his head—" Andy stopped and\r\nlaughed till they all laughed with him. "By gracious, Happy ought to\r\nstep up on him, once, and see how kind he is!" He laughed again\r\nuntil Happy, across the corral saddling the horse he had chosen,\r\nmuttered profanely at the derision he knew was pointed at himself.', '"Why, I\'ve seen that hoss—" Andy Green, once fairly started in the\r\nfascinating path of romance, invented details for the pure joy of\r\ncreation. If he had written some of the tales he told, and had sold\r\nthe writing for many dollars, he would have been famous. Since he did\r\nnot write them for profit, but told them for fun, instead, he earned\r\nmerely the reputation of being a great liar. A significant mark of his\r\ngenius lay in the fact that his inventions never failed to convince;\r\nnot till afterward did his audience doubt.', 'That is why the blue roan was not chosen in any of the strings, but\r\nwas left always circling in the corral after a loop had settled. That\r\nis why the Flying U boys looked at him askance as they passed him by.\r\nThat is why, when a certain Mr. Coleman, sent by the board of\r\ndirectors to rake northern Montana for bad horses, looked with favor\r\nupon the blue roan when he came to the Flying U ranch and heard the\r\ntale of his exploits as interpreted—I should say created—by Andy\r\nGreen.', '"We\'ve got to have him," he declared enthusiastically. "If he\'s as bad\r\nas all that, he\'ll be the star performer at the contest, and make that\r\ntwo-hundred-dollar plum a hard one to pick. Some of these gay boys\r\nhave entered with the erroneous idea that that same plum is hanging\r\nloose, and all they\'ve got to do is lean up against the tree and it\'ll\r\ndrop in their mouths. We\'ve got to have that roan. I\'ll pay you a good\r\nprice for him, Whitmore, if you won\'t let him go any other way. We\'ve\r\ngot a reporter up there that can do him up brown in a special\r\narticle, and people will come in bunches to see a horse with that kind\r\nof a pedigree. Is it Green, here, that knows the horse and what he\'ll\r\ndo? You\'re sure of him, are you, Green?"', "Andy took time to roll a cigarette. He had not expected any such\r\ndevelopment as this, and he needed to think of the best way out. All\r\nhe had wanted or intended was to discourage the others from claiming\r\nthe blue roan; he wanted him in his own string. Afterwards, when they\r\nhad pestered him about the roan's record, he admitted to himself that\r\nhe had, maybe, overshot the mark and told it a bit too scarey, and too\r\nconvincingly. Under the spell of fancy he had done more than make the\r\nroan unpopular as a roundup horse; he had made him a celebrity in the\r\nway of outlaw horses. And they wanted him in the rough-riding contest!\r\nAndy, perhaps, had never before been placed in just such a position.", '"Are you sure of what the horse will do?" Mr. Coleman repeated, seeing\r\nthat Andy was taking a long time to reply.', 'Andy licked his cigarette, twisted an end and leaned backward while he\r\nfelt in his pocket for a match. From the look of his face you never\r\ncould have told how very uncomfortable he felt "Naw," he drawled. "I\r\nain\'t never sure of what any hoss will do. I\'ve had too much\r\ndealings with \'em for any uh that brand uh foolishness." He lighted\r\nthe cigarette as if that were the only matter in which he took any\r\nreal interest, though he was thinking fast.', 'Mr. Coleman looked nonplussed. "But I thought—you said—"', '"What I said," Andy retorted evenly, "hit the blue roan two years ago;\r\nmaybe he\'s reformed since then; I dunno. Nobody\'s rode him, here." He\r\ncould not resist a sidelong glance at Happy Jack. "There was some talk\r\nof it, but it never come to a head."', '"Yuh offered me a hundred dollars—" Happy Jack began accusingly.', '"And yuh never made no move to earn it, that I know of. By gracious,\r\nyuh all seem to think I ought to mind-read that hoss! I ain\'t seen\r\nhim for two years. Maybe so, he\'s a real wolf yet; maybe so, he\'s a\r\nsheep." He threw out both his hands to point the end of the\r\nargument—so far as he was concerned—stuck them deep into his\r\ntrousers\' pockets and walked away before he could be betrayed into\r\ndeeper deceit. It did seem to him rather hard that, merely because he\r\nhad wanted the roan badly enough to—er—exercise a little diplomacy\r\nin order to get him, they should keep harping on the subject like\r\nthat. And to have Coleman making medicine to get the roan into that\r\ncontest was, to say the least, sickening. Andy\'s private belief was\r\nthat a twelve-year-old girl could go round up the milk-cows on that\r\nhorse. He had never known him to make a crooked move, and he had\r\nridden beside him all one summer and had seen him in all places and\r\nunder all possible conditions. He was a dandy cow-horse, and dead\r\ngentle; all this talk made him tired. Andy had forgotten that he\r\nhimself had started the talk.', 'Coleman went often to the corral when the horses were in, and looked\r\nat the blue roan. Later he rode on to other ranches where he had heard\r\nwere bad horses, and left the roan for further consideration. When he\r\nwas gone, Andy breathed freer and put his mind to the coming contest\r\nand the things he meant to do with the purse and with the other\r\ncontestants.', '"That Diamond G twister is going t\' ride," Happy Jack announced, one\r\nday when he came from town. "Some uh the boys was in town and they\r\nsaid so. He can ride, too. I betche Andy don\'t have no picnic gitting\r\nthe purse away from that feller. And Coleman\'s got that sorrel\r\noutlaw uh the HS. I betche Andy\'ll have to pull leather on that one."\r\nThis was, of course, treason pure and simple; but Happy Jack\'s\r\nprophecies were never taken seriously.', 'Andy simply grinned at him. "Put your money on the Diamond G twister,"\r\nhe advised calmly. "I know him—he\'s a good rider, too. His name\'s\r\nBilly Roberts. Uh course, I aim to beat him to it, but Happy never\r\ndoes like to have a sure-thing. He wants something to hang his jaw\r\ndown over. Put your money on Billy and watch it fade away, Happy."', '"Aw, gwan. I betche that there sorrel—"', '"I rode that there sorrel once, and combed his forelock with both\r\nspurs alternate," Andy lied boldly. "He\'s pickings. Take him back and\r\nbring me a real hoss."', 'Happy Jack wavered. "Well, I betche yuh don\'t pull down that money,"\r\nhe predicted vaguely. "I betche yuh git throwed, or something. It\r\ndon\'t do to be too blame sure uh nothing."', 'Whereat Andy laughed derisively and went away whistling. "I wish I was\r\nas sure uh living till I was a thousand years old, and able to ride\r\nnine months out of every year of \'em," he called back to Happy. Then\r\nhe took up the tune where he had left off.', 'For the days were still crisp at both ends and languorous in the\r\nmiddle, and wind and grasses hushed and listened for the coming of\r\nwinter. And because of these things, and his youth and his health, the\r\nheart of Andy Green was light in his chest and trouble stood afar off\r\nwith its face turned from him.', 'It was but three days to the opening of the fair when Coleman,\r\nreturning that way from his search for bad horses, clattered, with his\r\ngleanings and three or four men to help drive them, down the grade to\r\nthe Flying U. And in the Flying U coulee, just across the creek from\r\nthe corrals, still rested the roundup tents for a space. For the\r\nshipping was over early and work was not urgent, and Chip and the Old\r\nMan, in their enthusiasm for the rough-riding contest and the entry of\r\ntheir own man, had decided to take the wagons and crew entire to\r\nGreat Falls and camp throughout the four days of the fair. The boys\r\nall wanted to go, anyway, as did everybody else, so that nothing could\r\nbe done till it was over. It was a novel idea, and it tickled the\r\nhumor of the Happy Family.', 'The "rough string," as the bad horses were called, was corralled, and\r\nthe men made merry with the roundup crew. Diamond G men they were,\r\nloudly proclaiming their faith in Billy Roberts, and offering bets\r\nalready against Andy, who listened undisturbed and had very little to\r\nsay. The Happy Family had faith in him, and that was enough. If\r\neverybody, he told them, believed that he would win, where would be\r\nthe fun of riding and showing them?', 'It was after their early supper that Coleman came down to camp at the\r\nheels of Chip and the Old Man. Straightway he sought out Andy like a\r\nman who has something on his mind; though Andy did not in the least\r\nknow what it was, he recognized the indefinable symptoms and braced\r\nhimself mentally, half suspecting that it was something about that\r\nblue roan again. He was getting a little bit tired of the blue\r\nroan—enough so that, though he had chosen him for his string, he had\r\nnot yet put saddle to his back, but waited until the roundup started\r\nout once more, when he would ride him in his turn.', 'It was the blue roan, without doubt. Coleman came to a stop directly\r\nin front of Andy, and as directly came to the point.', '"Look here, Green," he began. "I\'m shy on horses for that contest, and\r\nWhitmore and Bennett say I can have that roan you\'ve got in your\r\nstring. If he\'s as bad as you claim, I certainly must have him. But\r\nyou seem to have some doubts of what he\'ll do, and I\'d like to see him\r\nridden once. Your shingle is out as a broncho-peeler. Will you ride\r\nhim this evening, so I can size him up for that contest?"', 'Andy glanced up under his eyebrows, and then sidelong at the crowd.\r\nEvery man within hearing was paying strict attention, and was eyeing\r\nhim expectantly; for broncho-fighting is a spectacle that never palls.', '"Well, I can ride him, if yuh say so," Andy made cautious answer, "but\r\nI won\'t gamble he\'s a bad hoss now—that is, bad enough to take to\r\nthe Falls. Yuh don\'t want to expect—"', '"Oh, I don\'t expect anything—only I want to see him ridden once.\r\nCome on, no time like the present. If he\'s bad, you\'ll have to ride\r\nhim at the fair, anyhow, and a little practice won\'t hurt you; and if\r\nhe isn\'t, I want to know it for sure."', '"It\'s a go with me," Andy said indifferently, though he secretly felt\r\nmuch relief. The roan would go off like a pet dog, and he could\r\npretend to be somewhat surprised, and declare that he had reformed.\r\nBad horses do reform, sometimes, as Andy and every other man in the\r\ncrowd knew. Then there would be no more foolish speculation about the\r\ncayuse, and Andy could keep him in peace and have a mighty good\r\ncow-pony, as he had schemed. He smoked a cigarette while Chip was\r\nhaving the horses corralled, and then led the way willingly, with\r\ntwenty-five men following expectantly at his heels. Unlike Andy, they\r\nfully expected an impromptu exhibition of fancy riding. Not all of\r\nthem had seen Andy atop a bad horse, and the Diamond G men, in\r\nparticular, were eager to witness a sample of his skill.', 'The blue roan submitted to the rope, and there was nothing spectacular\r\nin the saddling. Andy kept his cigarette between his lips and smiled\r\nto himself when he saw the saddle bunch hazed out through the gate\r\nand the big corral left empty of every animal but the blue roan, as\r\nwas customary when a man tackled a horse with the record which he had\r\ngiven the poor beast. Also, the sight of twenty-five men roosting\r\nhigh, their boot-heels hooked under a corral rail to steady them,\r\ntheir faces writ large with expectancy, amused him inwardly. He\r\npictured their disappointment when the roan trotted around the corral\r\nonce or twice at his bidding, and smiled again.', '"If you can\'t top him, Green, we\'ll send for Billy Roberts. He\'ll\r\ntake off the rough edge and gentle him down for yuh," taunted a\r\nDiamond G man.', '"Don\'t get excited till the show starts," Andy advised, holding the\r\ncigarette in his fingers while he emptied his lungs of smoke. Just to\r\nmake a pretence of caution, he shook the saddle tentatively by the\r\nhorn, and wished the roan would make a little show of resistance,\r\ninstead of standing there like an old cow, lacking only the cud, as he\r\ncomplained to himself, to make the resemblance complete. The roan,\r\nhowever, did lay back an ear when Andy, the cigarette again in his\r\nlips, put his toe in the stirrup.', '"Go after it, you weatherbeaten old saw-buck," he yelled, just to\r\nmake the play strong, before he was fairly in the saddle.', 'Then it was that the Happy Family, heart and soul and pocket all for\r\nAndy Green and his wonderful skill in the saddle; with many dollars\r\nbacking their belief in him and with voices ever ready to sing his\r\npraises; with the golden light of early sunset all about them and the\r\ntang of coming night-frost in the air, received a shock that made them\r\nturn white under their tan.', '"Mama!" breathed Weary, in a horrified half-whisper.', 'And Slim, goggle-eyed beside him, blurted, "Well, by golly!" in a\r\nvoice that carried across the corral.', 'For Andy Green, tamer of wild ones (forsooth!) broncho-twister with a\r\nfame that not the boundary of Chouteau County held, nor yet the\r\ncounties beyond; Andy Green, erstwhile "André de Gréno, champion\r\nbare-back rider of the Western Hemisphere," who had jumped through\r\nblazing hoops and over sagging bunting while he rode, turned\r\nhandsprings and done other public-drawing feats, was prosaically,\r\nunequivocally "piled" at the fifth jump!', 'That he landed lightly on his feet, with the cigarette still between\r\nhis lips, the roosting twenty-five quite overlooked. They saw only the\r\nfirst jump, where Andy, riding loose and unguardedly, went up on the\r\nblue withers. The second, third and fourth jumps were not far enough\r\napart to be seen and judged separately; as well may one hope to decide\r\nwhether a whirling wheel had straight or crooked spokes. The fifth\r\njump, however, was a masterpiece of rapid-fire contortion, and it was\r\nimportant because it left Andy on the ground, gazing, with an\r\nextremely grieved expression, at the uninterrupted convolutions of the\r\n"dandy little cow-hoss."', "The blue roan never stopped so much as to look back. He was\r\nbusy—exceedingly busy. He was one of those perverted brutes which\r\nbuck and bawl and so keep themselves wrought up to a high\r\npitch—literally and figuratively. He set himself seriously to throw\r\nAndy's saddle over his head, and he was not a horse which easily\r\naccepts defeat. Andy walked around in the middle of the corral, quite\r\naimlessly, and watched the roan contort. He could not understand in\r\nthe least, and his amazement overshadowed, for the moment, the fact\r\nthat he had been thrown and that in public and before men of the\r\nDiamond G.", 'Then it was that the men of the Diamond G yelled shrill words of\r\nironical sympathy. Then it was that the Happy Family looked at one\r\nanother in shamed silence, and to the taunts of the Diamond Gs made no\r\nreply. It had never occurred to them that such a thing could happen.\r\nHad they not seen Andy ride, easily and often? Had they not heard from\r\nPink how Andy had performed that difficult feat at the Rocking R—the\r\nfeat of throwing his horse flat in the middle of a jump? They waited\r\nuntil the roan, leaving the big corral looking, in the fast deepening\r\ntwilight, like a fresh-ploughed field, stopped dejectedly and stood\r\nwith his nose against the closed gate, and then climbed slowly down\r\nfrom the top rail of the corral, still silent with the silence more\r\neloquent than speech in any known language.', 'Over by the gate, Andy was yanking savagely at the latigo; and he,\r\nalso, had never a word to say. He was still wondering how it had\r\nhappened. He looked the roan over critically and shook his head\r\nagainst the riddle; for he had known him to be a quiet, dependable,\r\nall-round good horse, with no bad traits and an easy-going disposition\r\nthat fretted at nothing. A high-strung, nervous beast might, from\r\nrough usage and abuse, go "bad"; but the blue roan—they had called\r\nhim Pardner—had never showed the slightest symptom of nerves. Andy\r\nknew horses as he knew himself. That a horse like Pardner should, in\r\ntwo years, become an evil-tempered past-master in such devilish\r\npitching as that, was past belief.', '"I guess he\'ll do, all right," spoke Coleman at his elbow. "I\'ve seen\r\nhorses pitch, and I will say that he\'s got some specialties that are\r\nworth exhibiting." Then, as a polite way of letting Andy down easy, he\r\nadded, "I don\'t wonder you couldn\'t connect."', '"Connect—hell!" It was Andy\'s first realization of what his failure\r\nmeant to the others. He left off wondering about the roan, and faced\r\nthe fact that he had been thrown, fair and square, and that before an\r\naudience of twenty-five pairs of eyes which had seen rough riding\r\nbefore, and which had expected of him something better than they were\r\naccustomed to seeing.', '"I reckon Billy Roberts will have to work on that cayuse a while,"\r\nfleered a Diamond G man, coming over to them. "He\'ll gentle him down\r\nso that anybody—even Green, can ride him!"', 'Andy faced him hotly, opened his mouth for sharp reply, and closed it.\r\nHe had been "piled." Nothing that he could say might alter that fact,\r\nnor explanations lighten the disgrace. He turned and went out the\r\ngate, carrying his saddle and bridle with him.', '"Aw—and you was goin\' t\' ride in that contest!" wailed Happy Jack\r\nrecriminatingly. "And I\'ve got forty dollars up on yuh!"', '"Shut up!" snapped Pink in his ear, heart-broken but loyal to the\r\nlast. "Yuh going to blat around and let them Diamond Gs give yuh the\r\nlaugh? Hunt up something you can use for a backbone till they get out\r\nuh camp, for Heaven\'s sake! Andy\'s our man. So help me, Josephine, if\r\nanybody goes rubbing it in where I can hear, he\'ll get his face\r\npunched!"', '"Say, I guess we ain\'t let down on our faces, or anything!" sighed Cal\r\nEmmett, coming up to them. "I thought Andy could ride! Gee whiz, but\r\nit was fierce! Why, Happy could make a better ride than that!"', '"By golly, I want t\' have a talk with that there broncho-tamer," Slim\r\ngrowled behind them. "I got money on him. Is he goin t\' ride for that\r\npurse? \'Cause if he is, I ain\'t going a foot."', 'These and other remarks of a like nature made up the clamor that\r\nsurged in the ears of Andy as he went, disgraced and alone, up to the\r\ndeserted bunk-house where he need not hear what they were saying. He\r\nknew, deep in his heart, that he could ride that horse. He had been\r\nthrown because of his own unpardonable carelessness—a carelessness\r\nwhich he could not well explain to the others. He himself had given\r\nthe roan an evil reputation; a reputation that, so far as he knew, was\r\nlibel pure and simple. To explain now that he was thrown simply\r\nbecause he never dreamed the horse would pitch, and so was taken\r\nunaware, would simply be to insult their intelligence. He was not\r\nsupposed, after mounting a horse like that, to be taken unaware. He\r\nmight, of course, say that he had lied all along—but he had no\r\nintention of making any confession like that. Even if he did, they\r\nwould not believe him. Altogether, it was a very unhappy young man\r\nwho slammed his spurs into a far corner and kicked viciously a box he\r\nhad stumbled over in the dusk.', '"Trying to bust the furniture?" it was the voice of the Old Man at the\r\ndoor.', '"By gracious, it seems I can\'t bust bronks no more," Andy made\r\nrueful reply. "I reckon I\'ll just about have to bust the furniture or\r\nnothing."', 'The Old Man chuckled and came inside, sought the box Andy had kicked,\r\nand sat down upon it. Through the open door came the jumble of many\r\nvoices upraised in fruitless argument, and with it the chill of frost.\r\nThe Old Man fumbled for his pipe, filled it and scratched a match\r\nsharply on the box. In the flare of it Andy watched his kind old face\r\nwith its fringe of grayish hair and its deep-graven lines of whimsical\r\nhumor.', '"Doggone them boys, they ain\'t got the stayin\' qualities I give \'em\r\ncredit for having," he remarked, holding up the match and looking\r\nacross at Andy, humped disconsolately in the shadows. "Them Diamond G\r\nmen has just about got \'em on the run, right now. Yuh couldn\'t get a\r\nhundred-t\'-one bet, down there."', 'Andy merely grunted.', '"Say," asked the Old Man suddenly. "Didn\'t yuh kinda mistake that\r\nblue roan for his twin brother, Pardner? This here cayuse is called\r\nWeaver. I tried t\' get hold of t\'other one, but doggone \'em, they\r\nwouldn\'t loosen up. Pardner wasn\'t for sale at no price, but they\r\ntalked me into buying the Weaver; they claimed he\'s just about as good\r\na horse, once he\'s tamed down some—and I thought, seein\' I\'ve got\r\nsome real tamers on my pay-roll, I\'d take a chance on him. I thought\r\nyuh knew the horse—the way yuh read up his pedigree—till I seen yuh\r\nmount him. Why, doggone it, yuh straddled him like yuh was just\r\nclimbing a fence! Maybe yuh know your own business best—but didn\'t\r\nyuh kinda mistake him for Pardner? They\'re as near alike as two\r\nbullets run in the same mold—as far as looks go."', 'Andy got up and went to the door, and stood looking down the\r\ndusk-muffled hill to the white blotch which was the camp; listened to\r\nthe jumble of voices still upraised in fruitless argument, and turned\r\nto the Old Man.', '"By gracious, that accounts for a whole lot," he said ambiguously.', '"I don\'t see," said Cal Emmett crossly, "what\'s the use uh this whole\r\noutfit trailing up to that contest. If I was Chip, I\'d call the deal\r\noff and start gathering calves. It ain\'t as if we had a man to ride\r\nfor that belt and purse. Ain\'t your leg well enough to tackle it,\r\nPink?"', '"No," Pink answered shortly, "it ain\'t."', '"Riding the rough bunch they\'ve rounded up for that contest ain\'t\r\ngoing to be any picnic," Weary defended his chum. "Cadwolloper would\r\nneed two good legs to go up against that deal."', '"I wish Irish was here," Pink gloomed. "I\'d be willing to back him;\r\nall right. But it\'s too late now; he couldn\'t enter if he was here."', 'A voice behind them spoke challengingly. "I don\'t believe it would be\r\netiquette for one outfit to enter two peelers. One\'s enough, ain\'t\r\nit?"', 'The Happy Family turned coldly upon the speaker. It was Slim who\r\nanswered for them all. "I dunno as this outfit has got any peeler in\r\nthat contest. By golly, it don\'t look like it since las\' night!"', 'Weary was gentle, as always, but he was firm. "We kinda thought you\'d\r\nwant to withdraw," he added.', 'Andy Green, tamer of wild ones, turned and eyed Weary curiously. One\r\nmight guess, from telltale eyes and mouth, that his calmness did not\r\ngo very deep. "I don\'t recollect mentioning that I was busy penning\r\nany letter uh withdrawal," he said. "I got my sights raised to that\r\npurse and that belt. I don\'t recollect saying anything about lowering\r\n\'em."', '"Aw, gwan. I guess I\'ll try for that purse, too! I betche I got as\r\ngood a show as—"', '"Sure. Help yourself, it don\'t cost nothing. I don\'t doubt but what\r\nyou\'d make a real pretty ride, Happy." Andy\'s tone was deceitfully\r\nhearty. He did not sound in the least as if he would like to choke\r\nHappy Jack, though that was his secret longing.', '"Aw, gwan. I betche I could make as purty a ride as we\'ve\r\nsaw—lately." Happy Jack did not quite like to make the thing too\r\npersonal, for fear of what might happen after.', '"Yuh mean last night, don\'t yuh?" purred Andy.', '"Well, by golly, I wish you\'d tell us what yuh done it for!" Slim cut\r\nin disgustedly. "It was nacherlay supposed you could ride; we got\r\nmoney up on yuh! And then, by golly, to go and make a fluke like\r\nthat before them Diamond G men—to go and let that blue roan pile yuh\r\nup b\'fore he\'d got rightly started t\' pitch—If yuh\'d stayed with him\r\ntill he got t\' swappin\' ends there, it wouldn\'t uh looked quite so\r\nbad. But t\' go and git throwed down right in the start—By golly!"\r\nSlim faced Andy accusingly. "B\'fore them Diamond G men—and I\'ve got\r\nmoney up, by golly!"', '"Yuh ain\'t lost any money yet, have yuh?" Andy inquired patiently.\r\nWhat Andy felt like doing was to "wade into the bunch"; reason,\r\nhowever, told him that he had it coming from them, and to take his\r\nmedicine, since he could not well explain just how it had happened. He\r\ncould not in reason wonder that the faith of the Happy Family was\r\nshattered and that they mourned as lost the money they had already\r\nrashly wagered on the outcome of the contest. The very completeness of\r\ntheir faith in him, their very loyalty, seemed to them their undoing,\r\nfor to them the case was plain enough. If Andy could not ride the blue\r\nroan in their own corral, how was he to ride that same blue roan in\r\nGreat Falls? Or, if he could ride him, how could any sane man hope\r\nthat he could win the purse and the belt under the stringent rules of\r\nthe contest, where "riding on the spurs," "pulling leather" and a\r\ndozen other things were barred? So Andy, under the sting of their\r\ninnuendoes and blunt reproaches, was so patient as to seem to them\r\ncowed.', '"No, I ain\'t lost any yet, but by golly, I can see it fixin\' to fly,"\r\nSlim retorted heavily.', 'Andy looked around at the others, and smiled as sarcastically as was\r\npossible considering the mood he was in. "It sure does amuse me," he\r\nobserved, "to see growed men cryin\' before they\'re hurt! By gracious,\r\nI expect t\' make a stake out uh that fall! I can get long odds from\r\nthem Diamond Gs, and from anybody they get a chance to talk to. I\'m\r\nkinda planning," he lied boldly, "to winter in an orange grove and\r\nlisten at the birds singing, after I\'m through with the deal."', '"I reckon yuh can count on hearing the birds sing, all right," Pink\r\nsnapped back. "It\'ll be tra-la-la for yours, if last night\'s a fair\r\nsample uh what yuh expect to do with the blue roan." Pink walked\r\nabruptly away, looking very much like a sulky cherub.', '"I s\'pose yuh\'re aiming to give us the impression that you\'re going\r\nto ride, just the same," said Cal Emmett.', '"I sure am," came brief reply. Andy was beginning to lose his temper.\r\nHe had expected that the Happy Family would "throw it into him," to a\r\ncertain extent, and he had schooled himself to take their drubbing.\r\nWhat he had not expected was their unfriendly attitude, which went\r\nbeyond mere disappointment and made his offence—if it could be called\r\nthat—more serious than the occasion would seem to warrant. Perhaps\r\nJack Bates unwittingly made plain the situation when he remarked:', '"I hate to turn down one of our bunch; we\'ve kinda got in the habit uh\r\nhanging together and backing each other\'s play, regardless. But darn\r\nit, we ain\'t millionaires, none of us—and gambling, it is a sin. I\'ve\r\ngot enough up already to keep me broke for six months if I lose, and\r\nthe rest are in about the same fix. I ain\'t raising no long howl,\r\nAndy, but you can see yourself where we\'re kinda bashful about sinking\r\nany more on yuh than what we have. Maybe you can ride; I\'ve heard yuh\r\ncan, and I\'ve seen yuh make some fair rides, myself. But yuh sure\r\nfell down hard last night, and my faith in yuh got a jolt that fair\r\nbroke its back. If yuh done it deliberate, for reasons we don\'t know,\r\nfor Heaven\'s sake say so, and we\'ll take your word for it and forget\r\nyour rep for lying. On the dead, Andy, did yuh fall off deliberate?"', 'Andy bit his lip. His conscience had a theory of its own about\r\ntruth-telling, and permitted him to make strange assertions at times.\r\nStill, there were limitations. The Happy Family was waiting for his\r\nanswer, and he knew instinctively that they would believe him now. For\r\na moment, temptation held him. Then he squared his shoulders and spoke\r\ntruly.', '"On the dead, I hit the ground unexpected and inadvertant. I—"', '"If that\'s the case, then the farther yuh keep away from that contest\r\nthe better—if yuh ask me." Jack turned on his heel and followed\r\nPink.', 'Andy stared after him moodily, then glanced at the rest. With one\r\naccord they avoided meeting his gaze. "Damn a bunch uh quitters!" he\r\nflared hotly, and left them, to hunt up the Old Man and Chip—one or\r\nboth, it did not matter to him.', 'Pink it was who observed the Old Man writing a check for Andy. He\r\ntook it that Andy had called for his time, and when Andy rolled his\r\nbed and stowed it away in the bunk-house, saddled a horse and rode up\r\nthe grade toward town, the whole outfit knew for a certainty that Andy\r\nhad quit.', 'Before many hours had passed they, too, saddled and rode away, with\r\nthe wagons and the cavvy following after—and they were headed for\r\nGreat Falls and the fair there to be held; or, more particularly, the\r\nrough-riding contest to which they had looked forward eagerly and with\r\nmuch enthusiasm, and which they were now approaching gloomily and in\r\ndeep humiliation. Truly, it would be hard to find a situation more\r\ngalling to the pride of the Happy Family.', 'But Andy Green had not called for his time, and he had no intention of\r\nquitting; for Andy was also suffering from that uncomfortable malady\r\nwhich we call hurt pride, and for it he knew but one remedy—a remedy\r\nwhich he was impatient to apply. Because of the unfriendly attitude of\r\nthe Happy Family, Andy had refused to take them into his confidence,\r\nor to ride with them to the fair. Instead, he had drawn what money was\r\nstill placed to his credit on the pay-roll, had taken a horse and his\r\nriding outfit and gone away to Dry Lake, where he intended to take the\r\ntrain for Great Falls.', 'In Dry Lake, however, he found that the story of his downfall had\r\npreceded him, thanks to the exultant men of the Diamond G, and that\r\nthe tale had not shrunk in the telling. Dry Lake jeered him as openly\r\nas it dared, and part of it—that part which had believed in him—was\r\nquite as unfriendly as was the Happy Family. To a man they took it for\r\ngranted that he would withdraw from the contest, and they were not\r\ncareful to conceal what they thought. Andy found himself rather left\r\nalone, and he experienced more than once the unpleasant sensation of\r\nhaving conversation suddenly lag when he came near, and of seeing\r\ngroups of men dissolve awkwardly at his approach. Andy, before he had\r\nbeen in town an hour, was in a mood to do violence.', "For that reason he kept his plans rigidly to himself. When someone\r\nasked him if he had quit the outfit, he had returned gruffly that the\r\nFlying U was not the only cow-outfit in the country, and let the\r\nquestioner interpret it as he liked. When the train that had its nose\r\npointed to the southwest slid into town, Andy did not step on, as had\r\nbeen his intention. He remained idly leaning over the bar in Rusty\r\nBrown's place, and gave no heed. Later, when the eastbound came\r\nschreeching through at midnight, it found Andy Green on the platform\r\nwith his saddle, bridle, chaps, quirt and spurs neatly sacked, and\r\nwith a ticket for Havre in his pocket. So the wise ones said that they\r\nknew Andy would never have the nerve to show up at the fair, after the\r\nfluke he had made at the Flying U ranch, and those whose pockets were\r\nnot interested considered it a very good joke.", 'At Havre, Andy bought another ticket and checked the sack which held\r\nhis riding outfit; the ticket had Great Falls printed on it in bold,\r\nblack lettering. So that he was twelve hours late in reaching his\r\noriginal destination, and to avoid unwelcome discovery and comment he\r\ntook the sleeper and immediately ordered his berth made up, that he\r\nmight pass through Dry Lake behind the sheltering folds of the berth\r\ncurtains. Not that there was need of this elaborate subterfuge. He was\r\nsimply mad clear through and did not want to see or hear the voice of\r\nany man he knew. Besides, the days when he had danced in spangled\r\ntights upon the broad, gray rump of a galloping horse while a\r\nsober-clothed man in the middle of the ring cracked a whip and yelped\r\ncommands, had bred in him the unconscious love of a spectacular entry\r\nand a dramatic finish.', 'That is why he sought out the most obscure rooming house that gave any\r\npromise of decency and comfort, and stayed off Central Avenue and away\r\nfrom its loitering groups of range dwellers who might know him. That\r\nis why he hired a horse and rode early and alone to the fair grounds\r\non the opening day, and avoided, by a roundabout trail a certain\r\nsplotch of gray-white against the brown of the prairie, which he knew\r\ninstinctively to be the camp of the Flying U outfit, which had made\r\ngood time and were located to their liking near the river. Andy felt a\r\ntightening of the chest when he saw the familiar tents, and kicked his\r\nhired horse ill-naturedly in the ribs. It was all so different from\r\nwhat he had thought it would be.', "In those last two weeks, he had pictured himself riding vaingloriously\r\nthrough town on his best horse, with a new Navajo saddle-blanket\r\nmaking a dab of bright color, and a new Stetson hat dimpled\r\npicturesquely as to crown and tilted rakishly over one eye, and with\r\nhis silver-mounted spurs catching the light; around him would ride the\r\nHappy Family, also in gala attire and mounted upon the best horses in\r\ntheir several strings. The horses would not approve of the\r\nstreet-cars, and would circle and back—and it was quite possible,\r\neven probable, that there would be some pitching and some pretty\r\nriding before the gaping populace which did not often get a chance to\r\nview the real thing. People would stop and gaze while they went\r\nclattering by, and he, Andy Green, would be pointed out by the knowing\r\nones as a fellow that was going to ride in the contest and that stood\r\na good chance of winning. For Andy was but human, that he dreamed of\r\nthese things; besides, does not the jumping through blazing hoops and\r\nover sagging bunting while one rides, whet insiduously one's appetite\r\nfor the plaudits of the crowd?", 'The reality was different. He was in Great Falls, but he had not\r\nridden vaingloriously down Central Avenue surrounded by the Happy\r\nFamily, and watched by the gaping populace. Instead, he had chosen a\r\nside street and he had ridden alone, and no one had seemed to know or\r\ncare who he might be. His horse had not backed, wild-eyed, before an\r\napproaching car, and he had not done any pretty riding. Instead, his\r\nhorse had scarce turned an eye toward the jangling bell when he\r\ncrossed the track perilously close to the car, and he had gone\r\n"side-wheeling" decorously down the street—and Andy hated a pacing\r\nhorse. The Happy Family was in town, but he did not know where. Andy\r\nkicked his horse into a gallop and swore bitterly that he did not\r\ncare. He did not suppose that they gave him a thought, other than\r\nthose impelled by their jeopardized pockets. And that, he assured\r\nhimself pessimistically, is friendship!', 'He tied the hired horse to the fence and went away to the stables and\r\nfraternized with a hump-backed jockey who knew a few things himself\r\nabout riding and was inclined to talk unprofessionally. It was not at\r\nall as Andy had pictured the opening day, but he got through the time\r\nsomehow until the crowd gathered and the racing began. Then he showed\r\nhimself in the crowd of "peelers" and their friends, as unconcernedly\r\nas he might; and as unobtrusively. The Happy Family, he observed, was\r\nnot there, though he met Chip face to face and had a short talk with\r\nhim. Chip was the only one, aside from the Old Man, who really\r\nunderstood. Billy Roberts was there, and he greeted Andy\r\ncommiseratingly, as one speaks to the sick or to one in mourning; the\r\ntone made Andy grind his teeth, though he knew in his heart that Billy\r\nRoberts wished him well—up to the point of losing the contest to him,\r\nwhich was beyond human nature. Billy Roberts was a rider and knew—or\r\nthought he knew—just how "sore" Andy must be feeling. Also, in the\r\nkindness of his heart he tried blunderingly to hide his knowledge.', '"Going up against the rough ones?" he queried with careful\r\ncarelessness, in the hope of concealing that he had heard the tale of\r\nAndy\'s disgrace.', '"I sure am," Andy returned laconically, with no attempt to conceal\r\nanything.', 'Billy Roberts opened his eyes wide, and his mouth a little before he\r\nrecovered from his surprise. "Well, good luck to yuh," he managed to\r\nsay, "only so yuh don\'t beat me to it. I was kinda hoping yuh was too\r\nbashful to get out and ride before all the ladies."', 'Andy, remembering his days in the sawdust ring, smiled queerly; but\r\nhis heart warmed to Billy Roberts amazingly.', 'They were leaning elbows on the fence below the grand stand, watching\r\ndesultorily the endless preparatory manoeuvres of three men astride\r\nthe hind legs of three pacers in sulkies. "This side-wheeling business\r\ngives me a pain," Billy remarked, as the pacers ambled by for the\r\nfourth or fifth time. "I like caballos that don\'t take all day to\r\nwind \'em up before they go. I been looking over our bunch. They\'s\r\nhorses in that corral that are sure going to do things to us twenty\r\npeelers!"', '"By gracious, yes!" Andy was beginning to feel himself again. "That\r\nblue hoss—uh course yuh heard how he got me, and heard it with\r\ntrimmings—yuh may think he\'s a man-eater; but while he\'s a bad hoss,\r\nall right, he ain\'t the one that\'ll get yuh. Yuh want t\' watch out,\r\nBilly, for that HS sorrel. He\'s plumb wicked. He\'s got a habit uh\r\nthrowing himself backwards. They\'re keeping it quiet, maybe—but I\'ve\r\nseen him do it three times in one summer."', '"All right—thanks. I didn\'t know that. But the blue roan—"', '"The blue roan\'ll pitch and bawl and swap ends on yuh and raise hell\r\nall around, but he can be rode. That festive bunch up in the reserve\r\nseats\'ll think it\'s awful, and that the HS sorrel is a lady\'s hoss\r\nalongside him, but a real rider can wear him out. But that\r\nsorrel—when yuh think yuh got him beat, Billy, is when yuh want to\r\nwatch out!"', 'Billy turned his face away from a rolling dustcloud that came down the\r\nhome stretch with the pacers, and looked curiously at Andy. Twice he\r\nstarted to speak and did not finish. Then: "A man can be a sure-enough\r\nrider, and get careless and let a horse pile him off him when he ain\'t\r\nlooking, just because he knows he can ride that horse," he said with a\r\ncertain diffidence.', '"By gracious, yes!" Andy assented emphatically. And that was the\r\nnearest they came to discussing a delicate matter which was in the\r\nminds of both.', "Andy was growing more at ease and feeling more optimistic every\r\nminute. Three men still believed in him, which was much. Also, the\r\ncrowd could not flurry him as it did some of the others who were not\r\naccustomed to so great an audience; rather, it acted as a tonic and\r\nbrought back the poise, the easy self-confidence which had belonged to\r\none André de Gréno, champion bareback rider. So that, when the\r\nrough-riding began, Andy's nerves were placidly asleep.", 'At the corral in the infield, where the horses and men were\r\nforegathered, Andy met Slim and Happy Jack; but beyond his curt\r\n"Hello" and an amazed "Well, by golly!" from Slim, no words passed.\r\nAcross the corral he glimpsed some of the others—Pink and Weary, and\r\nfarther along, Cal Emmett and Jack Bates; but they made no sign if\r\nthey saw him, and he did not go near them. He did not know when his\r\nturn would come to ride, and he had a horse to saddle at the command\r\nof the powers that were. Coleman, the man who had collected the\r\nhorses, almost ran over him. He said "Hello, Green," and passed on,\r\nfor his haste was great.', 'Horse after horse was saddled and led perforce out into the open of\r\nthe infield; man after man mounted, with more or less trouble, and\r\nrode to triumph or defeat. Billy Roberts was given a white-eyed little\r\nbay, and did some great riding. The shouts and applause from the grand\r\nstand rolled out to them in a great wave of sound. Billy mastered the\r\nbrute and rode him back to the corral white-faced and with beads of\r\nsweat standing thick on his forehead.', '"It ain\'t going to be such damn\' easy money—that two hundred," he\r\nconfided pantingly to Andy, who stood near. "The fellow that gets it\r\nwill sure have to earn it."', 'Andy nodded and moved out where he could get a better view. Then\r\nColeman came and informed him hurriedly that he came next, and Andy\r\nwent back to his place. The horse he was to ride he had never seen\r\nbefore that day. He was a long-legged brown, with scanty mane and a\r\nwicked, rolling eye. He looked capable of almost any deviltry, but\r\nAndy did not give much time to speculating upon what he would try to\r\ndo. He was still all eyes to the infield where his predecessor was\r\ngyrating. Then a sudden jump loosened him so that he grabbed the\r\nhorn—and it was all over with that particular applicant, so far as\r\nthe purse and the championship belt were concerned. He was out of the\r\ncontest, and presently he was also back at the corral, explaining\r\nvolubly—and uselessly—just how it came about. He appeared to have a\r\nvery good reason for "pulling leather," but Andy was not listening and\r\nonly thought absently that the fellow was a fool to make a talk for\r\nhimself.', 'Andy was clutching the stirrup and watching a chance to put his toe\r\ninto it, and the tall brown horse was circling backwards with\r\noccasional little side-jumps. When it was quite clear that the horse\r\ndid not mean to be mounted, Andy reached out his hand, got a rope from\r\nsomebody—he did not know who, though, as a matter of fact, it was\r\nPink who gave it—and snared a front foot; presently the brown was\r\nstanding upon three legs instead of four, and the gaping populace\r\nwondered how it was done, and craned necks to see. After that, though\r\nthe horse still circled backwards, Andy got the stirrup and put his\r\ntoe in it and went up so easily that the ignorant might think anybody\r\ncould do it. He dropped the rope and saw that it was Pink who picked\r\nit up.', 'The brown at first did nothing at all. Then he gave a spring straight\r\nahead and ran fifty yards or so, stopped and began to pitch. Three\r\njumps and he ran again; stopped and reared. It was very pretty to look\r\nat, but Happy Jack could have ridden him, or Slim, or any other range\r\nrider. In two minutes the brown was sulking, and it took severe\r\nspurring to bring him back to the corral. Pitch he would not. The\r\ncrowd applauded, but Andy felt cheated and looked as he felt.', 'Pink edged toward him, but Andy was not in the mood for reconciliation\r\nand kept out of his way. Others of the Happy Family came near, at\r\ndivers times and places, as if they would have speech with him, but he\r\nthought he knew about what they would say, and so was careful not to\r\ngive them a chance. When the excitement was all over for that day he\r\ngot his despised hired horse and went back to town with Billy Roberts,\r\nbecause it was good to have a friend and because they wanted to talk\r\nabout the riding. Billy did not tell Andy, either, that he had had\r\nhard work getting away from his own crowd; for Billy was kind-hearted\r\nand had heard a good deal, because he had been talking with Happy\r\nJack. His sympathy was not with the Happy Family, either.', 'On the second afternoon, such is effect of rigid winnowing, there were\r\nbut nine men to ride. The fellow who had grabbed the saddle horn,\r\ntogether with ten others, stood among the spectators and made caustic\r\nremarks about the management, the horses, the nine who were left and\r\nthe whole business in general. Andy grinned a little and wondered if\r\nhe would stand among them on the morrow and make remarks. He was not\r\nworrying about it, though. He said hello to Weary, Pink and Cal\r\nEmmett, and saddled a kicking, striking brute from up Sweetgrass way.', 'On this day the horses were wickeder, and one man came near getting\r\nhis neck broken. As it was, his collar-bone snapped and he was carried\r\noff the infield on a stretcher and hurried to the hospital; which did\r\nnot tend to make the other riders feel more cheerful. Andy noted that\r\nit was the HS sorrel which did the mischief, and glanced meaningly\r\nacross at Billy Roberts.', 'Then it was his turn with the striking, kicking gray, and he mounted\r\nand prepared for what might come. The gray was an artist in his line,\r\nand pitched "high, wide and crooked" in the most approved fashion. But\r\nAndy, being also an artist of a sort, rode easily and with a grace\r\nthat brought much hand-clapping from the crowd. Only the initiated\r\nreserved their praise till further trial; for though the gray was not\r\nto say gentle, and though it took skill to ride him, there were a\r\ndozen, probably twice as many, men in the crowd who could have done as\r\nwell.', 'The Happy Family, drawn together from habit and because they could\r\nspeak their minds more freely, discussed Andy gravely among\r\nthemselves. Betting was growing brisk, and if their faith had not\r\nbeen so shaken they could have got long odds on Andy.', '"I betche he don\'t win out," Happy Jack insisted with characteristic\r\ngloom. "Yuh wait till he goes up agin that blue roan. They\'re savin\'\r\nthat roan till the las\' day—and I betche Andy\'ll git him. If he hangs\r\non till the las\' day." Happy Jack laughed ironically as he made the\r\nprovision.', '"Any you fellows got money yuh want to put up on this deal?" came the\r\nvoice of Andy behind them.', 'They turned, a bit shamefaced, toward him.', '"Aw, I betche—" began Happy.', '"That\'s what I\'m here for," cut in Andy. "What I\'ve got goes\r\nup—saddle, spurs—all I\'ve got. You\'ve done a lot uh mourning, now\r\nhere\'s a chance to break even on me. Speak up."', 'The Happy Family hesitated.', '"I guess I\'ll stay out," dimpled Pink. "I don\'t just savvy your play,\r\nAndy, and if I lose on yuh—why, it won\'t be the first time I ever\r\nwent broke."', '"Well, by golly, I\'ll take a chance," bellowed Slim, whose voice was\r\never pitched to carry long distances in a high wind. "I\'ll bet yuh\r\nfifty dollars yuh don\'t pull down that belt or purse. By golly,\r\nthere\'s two or three men here that can ride."', '"There\'s only one that\'ll be the real star," smiled Andy with\r\nunashamed egotism. "Happy, how rich do you want to get off me?"', 'Happy said a good deal and "betche" several things would\r\nhappen—things utterly inconsistent with one another. In the end, Andy\r\npinned him down to twenty dollars against Andy\'s silver-mounted\r\nspurs—which was almost a third more than the spurs were worth; but\r\nAndy had no sympathy for Happy Jack and stuck to the price doggedly\r\nuntil Happy gave in.', 'Jack Bates advertised his lack of faith in Andy ten dollars worth, and\r\nCal Emmett did the same. Irish, coming in on the afternoon train and\r\ndrifting instinctively to the vicinity of the Happy Family, cursed\r\nthem all impartially for a bunch of quitters, slapped Andy on the back\r\nand with characteristic impetuosity offered a hundred dollars to\r\nanybody who dared take him up, that Andy would win. And this after he\r\nhad heard the tale of the blue roan and before they told him about the\r\ntwo rides already made in the contest.', 'It is true that Happy Jack endeavored to expostulate, but Irish\r\nglared at him in a way to make Happy squirm and stammer incoherently.', '"I\'ve heard all about it," Irish cut in, "and I don\'t have to hear any\r\nmore. I know a rider when I see one, and my money\'s on Andy from start\r\nto finish. You make me sick. Weary, have you gone against our man?"\r\nThe tone was a challenge in itself.', 'Weary grinned goodnaturedly. "I haven\'t pulled down any bets," he\r\nanswered mildly, "and I haven\'t put up my last cent and don\'t intend\r\nto. I\'m an engaged young man." He shrugged his shoulders to point the\r\nmoral. "I sure do hope Andy\'ll win out," he added simply.', '"Hope? Why, damn it, yuh know he\'ll win!" stormed Irish.', 'Men in their vicinity caught the belligerence of the tone and turned\r\nabout, thinking there was trouble, and the Happy Family subsided into\r\nquieter discussion. In the end Irish, discovering that Andy had for\r\nthe time being forsworn the shelter of the Flying U tents, stuck by\r\nhim loyally and forswore it also, and went with Andy to share the\r\ndoubtful comfort of the obscure lodging house. For Irish was all or\r\nnothing, and to find the Happy Family publicly opposed—or at most\r\nneutral—to a Flying U man in a rough-riding contest like this,\r\nincensed him much.', 'The Happy Family began to feel less sure of themselves and a bit\r\nashamed—though of just what, they were not quite clear, for surely\r\nthey had reason a-plenty for doubting Andy Green.', 'The last day found the Happy Family divided against itself and growing\r\na bit venomous in its remarks. Andy had not as yet done anything\r\nremarkable, except perhaps keep in the running when the twenty had\r\nbeen culled to three: Billy Roberts, Andy and a man from the\r\nYellowstone Valley, called Gopher by his acquaintances. Accident and\r\nuntoward circumstances had thrown out the others—good riders all of\r\nthem, or they would not have been there. Happy Jack proclaimed loudly\r\nin camp that Andy was still in because Andy had not had a real bad\r\nhorse. "I seen Coleman looking over the blue roan and talkin\' to them\r\nguys that runs things; they\'re goin\' t\' put Andy on him t-day, I\r\nbetche—and we seen how he can ride him! Piled in a heap—"', '"Not exactly," Pink interrupted. "I seem to remember Andy lighting on\r\nhis feet; and he was smoking when he started, and smoking when he\r\nquit. It didn\'t strike me at the time, but that\'s kinda funny, don\'t\r\nyuh think?"', 'So Pink went back to his first faith, and the Happy Family straightway\r\nbecame loud and excited over the question of whether Andy did really\r\nlight upon his feet, or jumped up immediately, and whether he kept his\r\ncigarette or made a new one. The discussion carried them to the fair\r\ngrounds and remained just where it started, so far as any amicable\r\ndecision was concerned.', "Now this is a fair and true report of that last day's riding: There\r\nbeing but the three riders, and the excitement growing apace, the\r\nrough-riding was put first on the program and men struggled for the\r\nbest places and the best view of the infield.", 'In the beginning, Andy drew the HS sorrel and Billy Roberts the blue\r\nroan. Gopher, the Yellowstone man, got a sulky little buckskin that\r\nrefused to add one whit to the excitement, so that he was put back and\r\nanother one brought. This other proved to be the wicked-eyed brown\r\nwhich Andy had ridden the first day. Only this day the brown was in\r\ndifferent mood and pitched so viciously that Gopher lost control in\r\nthe rapid-fire changes, and rode wild, being all over the horse and\r\neverywhere but on the ground. He did not pull leather, however though\r\nhe was accused by some of riding on his spurs at the last. At any\r\nrate, Andy and Billy Roberts felt that the belt lay between\r\nthemselves, and admitted as much privately.', '"You\'ve sure got to ride like a wild man if yuh beat me to it,"\r\ngrinned Billy.', '"By gracious, I\'m after it like a wolf myself," Andy retorted. "Yuh\r\nknow how I\'m fixed—I\'ve just got to have it, Bill."', 'Billy, going out to ride, made no reply except a meaning head-shake.\r\nAnd Billy certainly rode, that day; for the blue roan did his worst\r\nand his best. To describe the performance, however, would be to invent\r\nmany words to supply a dearth in the language. Billy rode the blue\r\nroan back to the corral, and he had broken none of the stringent rules\r\nof the contest—which is saying much for Billy.', 'When Andy went out—shot out, one might say—on the sorrel, the Happy\r\nFamily considered him already beaten because of the remarkable riding\r\nof Billy. When the sorrel began pitching the gaping populace, grown\r\nwise overnight in these things, said that he was e-a-s-y—which he\r\nwas not. He fought as some men fight; with brain as well as muscle,\r\ncunningly, malignantly. He would stop and stand perfectly still for a\r\nfew seconds, and then spring viciously whichever way would seem to him\r\nmost unexpected; for he was not bucking from fright as most horses do\r\nbut because he hated men and would do them injury if he could.', 'When the crowd thought him worn out, so that he stood with head\r\ndrooping all that Andy would permit, then it was that Andy grew most\r\nwary. It was as he had said. Of a sudden, straight into the air leaped\r\nthe sorrel, reared and went backward in a flash of red. But as he\r\nwent, his rider slipped to one side, and when he struck the ground\r\nAndy struck also—on his feet. "Get up, darn yuh," he muttered, and\r\nwhen the sorrel gathered himself together and jumped up, he was much\r\nsurprised to find Andy in the saddle again.', 'Then it was that the HS sorrel went mad and pitched as he had never,\r\neven when building his record, pitched before. Then it was that Andy,\r\nhis own temper a bit roughened by the murderous brute, rode as he had\r\nnot ridden for many a day; down in the saddle, his quirt keeping time\r\nwith the jumps. He was just settling himself to "drag it out of him\r\nproper," when one of the judges, on horseback in the field, threw up\r\nhis hand.', '"Get off!" he shouted, galloping closer. "That horse\'s got to be rode\r\nagain to-day. You\'ve done enough this time."', 'So Andy, watching his chance, jumped off when the sorrel stopped for a\r\nfew seconds of breath, and left him unconquered and more murderous\r\nthan ever. A man with a megaphone was announcing that the contest was\r\nyet undecided, and that Green and Roberts would ride again later in\r\nthe afternoon.', "Andy passed the Happy Family head in air, stopped a minute to exchange\r\nfacetious threats with Billy Roberts, and went with Irish to roost\r\nupon the fence near the judge's stand to watch the races. The Happy\r\nFamily kept sedulously away from the two and tried to grow interested\r\nin other things until the final test.", 'It came, when Billy Roberts, again first, mounted the HS sorrel, still\r\nin murderous mood and but little the worse for his previous battle.\r\nWhat he had done with Andy he repeated, and added much venom to the\r\nrepetition. Again he threw himself backward, which Billy expected and\r\nso got clear and remounted as he scrambled up. After that, the sorrel\r\nsimply pitched so hard and so fast that he loosened Billy a bit; not\r\nmuch, but enough to "show daylight" between rider and saddle for two\r\nor three high, crooked jumps. One stirrup he lost, rode a jump without\r\nit and by good luck regained it as it flew against his foot. It was\r\ngreat riding, and a gratifying roar of applause swept out to him when\r\nit was over.', 'Andy, saddling the blue roan, drew a long breath. This one ride would\r\ntell the tale, and he was human enough to feel a nervous strain such\r\nas had not before assailed him. It was so close, now! and it might\r\nsoon be so far. A bit of bad luck such as may come to any man, however\r\ngreat his skill, and the belt would go to Billy. But not for long\r\ncould doubt or questioning hold Andy Green. He led the Weaver out\r\nhimself, and instinctively he felt that the horse remembered him and\r\nwould try all that was in him. Also, he was somehow convinced that the\r\nblue roan held much in reserve, and that it would be a great fight\r\nbetween them for mastery.', 'When he gathered up the reins, the roan eyed him wickedly sidelong and\r\ntightened his muscles, as it were, for the struggle. Andy turned the\r\nstirrup, put in his toe, and went up in a flash, warned by something\r\nin the blue roan\'s watchful eye. Like a flash the blue roan also went\r\nup—but Andy had been a fraction of a second quicker. There was a\r\nsqueal that carried to the grand stand as the Weaver, wild-eyed and\r\nwith red flaring nostrils, pounded the wind-baked sod with high,\r\nbone-racking jumps; changed and took to "weaving" till one wondered\r\nhow he kept his footing—more particularly, how Andy contrived to sit\r\nthere, loose-reined, firm-seated, riding easily. The roan, tiring of\r\nthat, began "swapping ends" furiously and so fast one could scarce\r\nfollow his jumps. Andy, with a whoop of pure defiance, yanked off his\r\nhat and beat the roan over the head with it, yelling taunting words\r\nand contemptuous; and for every shout the Weaver bucked harder and\r\nhigher, bawling like a new-weaned calf.', 'Men who knew good riding when they saw it went silly and yelled and\r\nyelled. Those who did not know anything about it caught the infection\r\nand roared. The judges galloped about, backing away from the living\r\nwhirlwind and yelling with the rest. Came a lull when the roan stood\r\nstill because he lacked breath to continue, and the judges shouted an\r\nuneven chorus.', '"Get down—the belt\'s yours"—or words to that effect. It was\r\nunofficial, that verdict, but it was unanimous and voiced with\r\nenthusiasm.', 'Andy turned his head and smiled acknowledgment. "All right—but wait\r\ntill I tame this hoss proper! Him and I\'ve got a point to settle!" He\r\ndug in his spurs and again the battle raged, and again the crowd, not\r\nhaving heard the unofficial decision, howled and yelled approval of\r\nthe spectacle.', 'Not till the roan gave up completely and owned obedience to rein and\r\nvoiced command, did Andy take further thought of the reward. He\r\nsatisfied himself beyond doubt that he was master and that the Weaver\r\nrecognized him as such. He wheeled and turned, "cutting out" an\r\nimaginary animal from an imaginary herd; he loped and he walked,\r\nstopped dead still in two jumps and started in one. He leaned and ran\r\nhis gloved hand forgivingly along the slatey blue neck, reached\r\nfarther and pulled facetiously the roan\'s ears, and the roan meekly\r\npermitted the liberties. He half turned in the saddle and slapped the\r\nplump hips, and the Weaver never moved. "Why, you\'re an all-right\r\nlittle hoss!" praised Andy, slapping again and again.', 'The decision was being bellowed from the megaphone and Andy, hearing\r\nit thus officially, trotted over to where a man was holding out the\r\nbelt that proclaimed him champion of the state. Andy reached out a\r\nhand for the belt, buckled it around his middle and saluted the grand\r\nstand as he used to do from the circus ring when one André de Grenó\r\nhad performed his most difficult feat.', 'The Happy Family crowded up, shamefaced and manfully willing to own\r\nthemselves wrong.', '"We\'re down and ready to be walked on by the Champion," Weary\r\nannounced quizzically. "Mama mine! but yuh sure can ride."', 'Andy looked at them, grinned and did an exceedingly foolish thing,\r\njust to humiliate Happy Jack, who, he afterwards said, still looked\r\nunconvinced. He coolly got upon his feet in the saddle, stood so while\r\nhe saluted the Happy Family mockingly, lighted the cigarette he had\r\njust rolled, then, with another derisive salute, turned a double\r\nsomersault in the air and lighted upon his feet—and the roan did\r\nnothing more belligerent than to turn his head and eye Andy\r\nsuspiciously.', '"By gracious, maybe you fellows\'ll some day own up yuh don\'t know it\r\nall!" he cried, and led the Weaver back into the corral and away from\r\nthe whooping maniacs across the track.', 'Andy Green licked a cigarette into shape the while he watched with\r\nunfriendly eyes the shambling departure of their guest. "I believe the\r\ndarned old reprobate was lyin\' to us," he remarked, when the horseman\r\ndisappeared into a coulee.', '"You sure ought to be qualified to recognize the symptoms," grunted\r\nCal Emmett, kicking his foot out of somebody\'s carelessly coiled rope\r\non the ground. "That your rope, Happy? No wonder you\'re always on the\r\nbum for one. If you\'d try tying it on your saddle—"', '"Aw, g\'wan. That there\'s Andy\'s rope—"', '"If you look at my saddle, you\'ll find my rope right where it\r\nbelongs," Andy retorted. "I ain\'t sheepherder enough to leave it\r\nkicking around under foot. That rope belongs to his nibs that just\r\nrode off. When he caught up his horse again after dinner, he throwed\r\nhis rope down while he saddled up, and then went off and forgot it. He\r\nwasn\'t easy in his mind—that jasper wasn\'t. I don\'t go very high on\r\nthat hard-luck tale he told. I know the boy he had wolfing with him\r\nlast winter, and he wasn\'t the kind to pull out with all the stuff he\r\ncould get his hands on. He was an all-right fellow, and if there\'s\r\nbeen any rusty work done down there in the breaks, this shifty-eyed\r\nmark done it. He was lying—"', 'Somebody laughed suddenly, and another chuckle helped to point the\r\njoke, until the whole outfit was in an uproar; for of all the men who\r\nhad slept under Flying-U tents and eaten beside the mess-wagon, Andy\r\nGreen was conceded to be the greatest, the most shameless and wholly\r\nincorrigible liar of the lot.', '"Aw, yuh don\'t want to get jealous of an old stiff like that," Pink\r\nsoothed musically. "There ain\'t one of us but what knows you could lie\r\nfaster and farther and more of it in a minute, with your tongue\r\nhalf-hitched around your palate and the deaf-and-dumb language barred,\r\nthan any three men in Chouteau County. Don\'t let it worry yuh, Andy."', '"I ain\'t letting it worry me," said Andy, getting a bit red with\r\ntrying not to show that the shot hit him. "When my imagination gets to\r\nsoaring, I\'m willing to bet all I got that it can fly higher than the\r\nrest of you, that have got brains about on a par with a sage-hen, can\r\nfollow. When I let my fancy soar, I take notice the rest of yuh like\r\nto set in the front row, all right—and yuh never, to my knowledge,\r\ncalled it a punk show when the curtain rung down; yuh always got the\r\nworth uh your money, and then some.', '"But if yuh\'d taken notice of the load that old freak was trying to\r\nthrow into the bunch, you\'d suspicion there was something scaley about\r\nit; there was, all right. I\'d gamble on it."', '"From the symptoms," spoke Weary mildly, rising to an elbow, "Andy\'s\r\nabout to erupt one of those wide, hot, rushing streams of melted\r\nimagination that bursts forth from his think-works ever so often.\r\nDon\'t get us all worked up over it, Andy; what\'s it going to be this\r\ntime? A murder in the Bad-lands?"', 'Andy clicked his teeth together, thought better of his ill-humor and\r\nmade reply, though he had intended to remain dignifiedly silent.', '"Yuh rung the bell, m\'son—but it ain\'t any josh. By gracious, I mean\r\nit!" He glared at those who gurgled incredulously, and went on: "No,\r\nsir, you bet it ain\'t any josh with me this time. That old gazabo\r\nhad something heavy on his conscience—and knowing the fellow he had\r\nreference to, I sure believe he lied a whole lot when he said Dan\r\npulled out with all the stuff they\'d got together, and went down\r\nriver. Maybe he went down river, all right—but if he did, it was most\r\nlikely to be face-down. Dan was as honest a boy as there is in the\r\ncountry, and he had money on him that he got mining down in the little\r\nRockies last summer. I know, because he showed me the stuff last fall\r\nwhen I met him in Benton, and he was fixing to winter with this fellow\r\nthat just left.', '"Dan was kinda queer about some things, and one of \'em was about\r\nmoney. It never made any difference how much or how little he had, he\r\nalways packed it in his clothes; said a bank had busted on him once\r\nand left him broke in the middle uh winter, and he wasn\'t going to let\r\nit happen again. He never gambled none, nor blowed his money any\r\nfarther than a couple uh glasses uh beer once in a while. He was one\r\nuh these saving cusses—but he was honest; I know that for a fact.', '"So he had all this money on him, and went down there with this\r\njasper, that he\'d got in with somehow and didn\'t know much about, and\r\nthey wolfed all winter, according to all accounts, and must uh made\r\nquite a stake, the way the bounty runs up, these days. And here comes\r\nthis darned Siwash, hiking out uh there fast as he can—and if he\r\nhadn\'t run slap onto us at this crossing, I\'ll gamble he\'d never uh\r\nshowed up at camp at all, but kept right on going. We didn\'t ask him\r\nno questions, did we? But he goes to all the pains uh telling us his\r\ntale uh woe, about how Dan had robbed him and pulled out down river.', '"If that was the case, wouldn\'t he be apt to hike out after him and\r\ntry and get back his stuff? And wouldn\'t—"', '"How much money did this friend uh yours have?" queried Jack Bates\r\ninnocently.', '"Well, when I seen him in Benton, he had somewhere between six and\r\nseven hundred dollars. He got it all changed into fifty-dollar\r\nbills—"', '"Oh, golly!" Jack Bates rolled over in disgust. "Andy\'s losing his\r\ngrip. Why, darn yuh, if you was in a normal, lying condition, you\'d\r\nmake it ten thousand, at the lowest—and I\'ve seen the time when you\'d\r\nuh said fifty thousand; and you\'d uh made us swallow the load, too!\r\nBuck up and do a good stunt, Andy, or else keep still. Why, Happy\r\nJack could tell that big a lie!"', '"Aw, gwan!" Happy Jack rose up to avenge the insult. "Yuh needn\'t\r\ncompare me to Andy Green. I ain\'t a liar, and I can lick the darned\r\nson-of-a-gun that calls me one. I ain\'t, and yuh can\'t say I am,\r\nunless yuh lie worse\'n Andy."', '"Calm down," urged Weary pacifically. "Jack said yuh could lie; he\r\ndidn\'t say—"', '"By gracious, you\'d think I was necked up with a whole bunch uh George\r\nWashingtons!" growled Andy, half-indignantly. "And what gets me is,\r\nthat I tell the truth as often as anybody in the outfit; oftener than\r\nsome I could mention. But that ain\'t the point. I\'m telling the truth\r\nnow, when I say somebody ought to hike down to their camp and see what\r\nthis old skunk has done with Dan. I\'d bet money you\'d find him sunk in\r\nthe river, or cached under a cut-bank, or something like that. If he\'d\r\nkept his face closed I wouldn\'t uh give it a second thought, but the\r\nmore I think uh the story he put up, the more I believe there\'s\r\nsomething wrong. He\'s made way with Dan somehow, and—"', '"Yes. Sure thing," drawled Pink wickedly. "Let\'s organize a searching\r\nparty and go down there and investigate. It\'s only about a three or\r\nfour days\' trip, through the roughest country the Lord ever stood on\r\nend to cool and then forgot till it crumpled down in spots and got set\r\nthat way, so He just left it go and mixed fresh mud for the job He was\r\nworking on. Andy\'d lead us down there, and we\'d find—"', '"His friend Dan buried in a tomato can, maybe," supplied Jack Bates.', '"By golly, I\'ll bet yuh could put friend Dan into one," Slim burst\r\nout. "By golly, I never met up with no Dan that packed fifty-dollar\r\nbills around in his gun-pocket—"', '"Andy\'s telling the truth. He says so," reproved Weary. "And when Andy\r\nsays a thing is the truth, yuh always know—"', '"It ain\'t." Cal Emmett finished the sentence, but Weary paid no\r\nattention.', '"—what to expect. Cadwolloper\'s right, and we ought to go down there\r\nand make a hunt for friend Dan and his fifty-dollar bills. How many\r\nwere there, did yuh say?"', '"You go to the devil," snapped Andy, getting up determinedly. "Yuh\r\nbite quick enough when anybody throws a load at yuh that would choke a\r\nrhinoscerous, but plain truth seems to be too much for the weak heads\r\nof yuh. I guess I\'ll have to turn loose and lie, so yuh\'ll listen to\r\nme. There is something crooked about this deal—"', '"We all thought it sounded that way," Weary remarked mildly.', '"And if yuh did go down to where them two wintered, you\'d find out I\'m\r\nright. But yuh won\'t, and that old cutthroat will get off with the\r\nmurder—and the money."', '"Don\'t he lie natural?" queried Jack Bates solemnly.', "That was too much. Andy glared angrily at the group, picked up the\r\nwolfer's rope, turned on his heel and walked off to where his horse\r\nwas tied; got on him and rode away without once looking back, though\r\nhe knew quite well that they were watching every move he made. It did\r\nnot help to smooth his temper that the sound of much laughing followed\r\nhim as he swung into the trail taken by the man who had left not long\r\nbefore.", "Where he went, that afternoon when for some reason sufficient for the\r\nforeman—who was Chip Bennett—the Flying U roundup crew lay\r\nluxuriously snoring in the shade instead of riding hurriedly and\r\nhotly the high divides, no one but Andy himself knew. They talked\r\nabout him after he left, and told one another how great a liar he was,\r\nand how he couldn't help it because he was born that way, and how you\r\ncould hardly help believing him. They recalled joyously certain of his\r\nfabrications that had passed into the history of the Flying U, and\r\nwondered what josh he was trying to spring this time.", '"What we ought to do," advised Cal, "is to lead him on and let him lie\r\nhis darndest, and make out we believe him. And then we can give him\r\nthe laugh good and plenty—and maybe cure him."', '"Cure nothing!" exclaimed Jack Bates, getting up because the sun had\r\ndiscovered him, and going over to the mess-wagon where a bit of shade\r\nhad been left unoccupied. "About the only way to cure Andy of lying,\r\nis to kill him. He was working his way up to some big josh, and if yuh\r\nlet him alone you\'ll find out what it is, all right. I wouldn\'t worry\r\nnone about it, if I was you." To prove that he did not worry, Jack\r\nimmediately went to sleep.', "Such being the attitude of the Happy Family, when Andy rode hurriedly\r\ninto camp at sundown, his horse wet to the tips of his ears with\r\nsweat, they sat up, expectancy writ large upon their faces. No one\r\nsaid anything, however, while Andy unsaddled and came over to beg a\r\nbelated supper from the cook; nor yet while he squatted on his heels\r\nbeside the cook-tent and ate hungrily. He seemed somewhat absorbed in\r\nhis thoughts, and they decided mentally that Andy was a sure-enough\r\ngood actor, and that if they were not dead next to him and his\r\nparticular weakness, they would swallow his yarn whole—whatever it\r\nwas. A blood-red glow was in the sky to the west, and it lighted\r\nAndy's face queerly, like a vivid blush on the face of a girl.", 'Andy scraped his plate thoughtfully with his knife, looked into his\r\ncoffee-cup, stirred the dregs absently and dipped out half a spoonful\r\nof undissolved sugar, which he swallowed meditatively. He tossed\r\nplate, cup and spoon toward the dishpan, sent knife and fork after\r\nthem and got out his smoking material. And the Happy Family, grouped\r\nrather closely together and watching unobtrusively, stirred to the\r\nlistening point. The liar was about to lie.', '"Talk about a guilty conscience giving a man dead away," Andy began,\r\nquite unconscious of the mental attitude of his fellows, and\r\nforgetting also his anger of the afternoon, "it sure does work out\r\nlike that, sometimes. I followed that old devil, just out uh\r\ncuriosity, to see if he headed for Dry Lake like he said he was going.\r\nWe didn\'t have any reason for keeping cases on him, or suspicioning\r\nanything—but he acted like we was all out on his trail, the fool!', '"I kinda had a hunch that if he had been up to any deviltry, it would\r\nshow on him when he left here, and I was plumb right about it. He went\r\nall straight enough till he got down into Black Coulee; and right\r\nthere it looked like he got kinda panicky and suspicious, for he\r\nturned square off the trail and headed up the coulee."', '"He must uh had \'em," Weary commented, quite as if he believed.', '"Yuh wait till I\'m through," Andy advised, still wholly unconscious of\r\ntheir disbelief. "Yuh was all kinda skeptical when I told yuh he had a\r\nguilty conscience, but I was right about it, and come mighty near\r\nlaying out on the range to-night with my toes pointing straight up,\r\njust because you fellows wouldn\'t—"', '"Sun-stroke?" asked Pink, coming closer, his eyes showing purple in\r\nthe softened light.', '"No—yuh wait, now, till I tell yuh." Whereupon Andy smoked\r\nrelishfully and in silence, and from the tail of his eye watched his\r\naudience squirm with impatience. "A man gets along a whole lot better\r\nwithout any conscience," he began at last, irrelevantly, "\'specially\r\nif he wants to be mean. I trailed this jasper up the coulee and out on\r\nthe bench, across that level strip between Black Coulee and Dry Spring\r\nGulch, and down the gulch a mile or so. He was fogging right along,\r\nand seemed as if he looked back every ten rods—I know he spotted me\r\njust as I struck the level at the head uh Black Coulee, because he\r\nacted different then.', '"I could see he was making across country for the trail to Chinook,\r\nbut I wanted to overhaul him and have a little casual talk about Dan.\r\nI don\'t suppose yuh noticed I took his rope along; I wanted some\r\nexcuse for hazing after him like that, yuh see."', '"Uh course, such accommodating cusses as you wouldn\'t be none strange\r\nto him," fleered Cal.', '"Well, he never found out what I was after," sighed Andy. "It wasn\'t\r\nmy fault I didn\'t come up with him, and my intentions were peaceful\r\nand innocent. But do yuh know what happened? He got out uh sight down\r\nDry Spring Gulch—yuh know where that elephant-head rock sticks out,\r\nand the trail makes a short turn around it—that\'s where I lost sight\r\nof him. But he wasn\'t very far in the lead, and I was dead anxious to\r\ngive him his rope, so I loped on down—"', '"You were taking long chances, old-timer; that\'s mighty rough going,\r\nalong there," hinted Chip, gravely.', '"Sure, I was," Andy agreed easily. "But yuh recollect, I was in a\r\nhurry. So I\'d just rounded the elephant\'s head, when bing! something\r\nspats the rock, just over my right shoulder, and my horse squatted\r\ndown on his rump and said he\'d gone far enough. I kinda felt the same\r\nway about it, so when he wheeled and humped himself back up the trail,\r\nI didn\'t argue none with him."', 'There was silence so deep one could hear the saddle-bunch cropping the\r\nthick grasses along the creek. If this were true—this tale that Andy\r\nwas telling—The Happy Family, half tempted to believe, glanced\r\nfurtively at one another.', '"Aw, gwan!" It was the familiar, protesting croak of Happy Jack. "What\r\ndid yuh turn tail for? Why didn\'t yuh have it out with him?" The\r\nHappy Family drew a long breath, and the temptation to believe was\r\npushed aside.', '"Because my gun was rolled up in my bed," Andy replied simply. "I\r\nain\'t as brave as you are, Happy. I ain\'t got the nerve to ride right\r\nup on a man that\'s scared plumb silly and pumping lead my way fast as\r\nhe can work the lever on his rifle, and lick him with my fists till he\r\nhowls, and then throw him and walk up and down his person and flap my\r\nwings and crow. It\'s awful to have to confess it, but I\'m willing to\r\nrun from any man that\'s shooting at me when I can\'t shoot back. I\'d\r\ngive a lot to be as brave as you are, Happy."', 'Happy Jack growled and subsided.', '"Well, by golly, there\'s times when we\'d be justified in shooting\r\nyuh, but I don\'t see what he\'d want to do it for," objected Slim.', '"Guilty conscience, I told yuh," retorted Andy. "He seen I was chasing\r\nhim up, and I guess he thought it was somebody that had got next to\r\nwhat happened—Lord, I wish I knew what did happen, down there in the\r\nbreaks! Boys," Andy got up and stood looking earnestly down at them in\r\nthe twilight, "you can\'t make me believe that there hasn\'t been a\r\nmurder done! That fellow has been up to something, or he wouldn\'t be\r\nacting so damn\' queer. And if it was just plain stealing, Dan would\r\nsure be hot on his trail—because Dan thought more of his money than\r\nmost men do of their wives. It was about all he lived for, and he\r\nwasn\'t any coward. That old man never would get it off him without a\r\nbig ruction, and if he did, Dan would be right after him bigger\'n a\r\nwolf. There\'s something wrong, you take my word."', '"What do yuh want us to do about it?" It was Chip who asked the\r\nquestion, and his tone was quite calm and impersonal.', 'Andy looked at him reproachfully. "Do? What is there to do, except go\r\ndown there and see? If we can find that out, we can put the sheriff\r\nwise and let him do the rest. It sure does seem kinda tough, if a man\r\ncan do a murder and robbery and get off with it, just because nobody\r\ncares enough about it to head him off."', "The Happy Family stirred uneasily. Of course, it was all just a josh\r\nof Andy's—but he was such a convincing liar! Almost they felt guilty\r\nof criminal negligence that they did not at once saddle up and give\r\nchase to the murderer, who had tried to kill Andy for following him,\r\nand who was headed for Chinook after unnecessarily proclaiming\r\nhimself bound for Dry Lake.", '"Do you want the whole outfit to turn out?" asked Chip calmly at last.', '"No-o—"', '"Say, is it anywheres near that prehistoric castle you found once?"\r\nPing asked maliciously, unbelief getting strong hold of him again.', 'Andy turned toward him, scowling. "No, Angel-child, it ain\'t," he\r\nsnapped. "And you fellows can back up and snort all yuh darn please,\r\nand make idiots of yourselves. But yuh can\'t do any business making me\r\nout a hot-air peddler on this deal. I stand pat, just where I stood\r\nat first, and it\'ll take a lot uh cackling to make me back down. That\r\nold devil did lie about Dan, and he did take a shot at me—"', '"He took yuh for a horse-thief, most likely," explained Jack Bates.', '"He didn\'t need no field glass to see you was a suspicious character,\r\nby golly," chortled Slim.', '"He thought yuh was after what little your friend Dan had overlooked,\r\nchances is," added Cal Emmett.', '"Did the fog roll down and hide the horrible sight?" asked Jack\r\nBates.', "That, and much more, brought about a distinct coldness between the\r\nHappy Family and one Andy Green, so that the sun went down upon Andy's\r\nwrath, and rose to find it still bubbling hotly in the outraged heart\r\nof him.", 'It was Jack Bates who precipitated an open war by singing an adapted\r\nversion of "Massa\'s In the Cold, Cold Ground," just when they were\r\neating breakfast. As an alleged musical effort it was bad enough, but\r\nas a personal insult it was worse. One hesitates to repeat the\r\ndoggerel, even in an effort to be exact. However, the chorus, bellowed\r\nshamelessly by Jack, was this:', '"Down in the Bad-lands, hear that awful sound.\r\nAndy Green is there a-weeping—"', 'Jack Bates got no further than that, for Andy first threw his plate at\r\nJack and then landed upon him with much force and venom, so that Jack\r\nwent backwards and waved long legs convulsively in the air, and the\r\nHappy Family stood around and howled their appreciation of the\r\nspectacle.', 'When it dawned upon them that Andy was very much in earnest, and that\r\nhis fist was landing with unpleasant frequency just where it was most\r\npainful to receive it, they separated the two by main strength and\r\nargued loudly for peace. But Andy was thoroughly roused and would have\r\nnone of it, and hurled at them profanity and insulting epithets, so\r\nthat more than Jack Bates looked upon him with unfriendly eyes and\r\nsaid things which were not calculated to smooth roughened tempers.', '"That\'s a-plenty, now," quelled Chip, laying detaining hand upon the\r\nnearest, who happened to be Andy himself. "You sound like a bunch of\r\nold women. What do you want to do the worst and quickest, Andy?—and I\r\ndon\'t mean killing off any of these alleged joshers, either."', 'Andy clicked his teeth together, swallowed hard and slowly unclenched\r\nhis hands and grinned; but the grin was not altogether a pleasant one,\r\nand the light of battle still shone in the big, gray eyes of him.', '"You\'re the boss," he said, "but if yuh don\'t like my plans you\'ll\r\njust have one less to pay wages to. What I\'m going to do is throw my\r\nsaddle on my private horse and ride down into the Bad-lands and see\r\nfor myself how the cards lay. Maybe it\'s awful funny to the rest of\r\nyuh, but I\'m takin\' it kinda serious, myself, and I\'m going to find\r\nout how about it before I\'m through. I can\'t seem to think it\'s a josh\r\nwhen some old mark makes a play like that fellow did, and tries to put\r\na bullet into my carcass for riding the same trail he took. It\'s me\r\nfor the Bad-lands—and you can think what yuh damn\' please about it."', 'Chip stood quite still till he was through, and eyed him sharply. "You\r\nbetter take old Buck to pack your blankets and grub," he told him, in\r\na matter-of-fact tone. "We\'ll be swinging down that way in two or\r\nthree days; by next Saturday you\'ll find us camped at the mouth of\r\nJump-off Coulee, if nothing happens. That\'ll give you four days to\r\nprowl around. Come on, boys—we\'ve got a big circle ahead of us this\r\nmorning, and it\'s going to be hot enough to singe the tails off our\r\ncayuses by noon."', "That, of course, settled the disturbance and set the official seal of\r\napproval upon Andy's going; for Chip was too wise to permit the affair\r\nto grow serious, and perhaps lose a man as good as Andy; family\r\nquarrels had not been entirely unknown among the boys of the Flying\r\nU, and with tact they never had been more than a passing\r\nunpleasantness. So that, although Jack Bates swore vengeance and\r\nnursed sundry bruised spots on his face, and though Andy saddled,\r\npacked old Buck with his blankets and meager camp outfit and rode off\r\nsullenly with no word to anyone and only a scowling glance or two for\r\nfarewell, Chip mounted and rode cheerfully away at the head of his\r\nHappy Family, worrying not at all over the outcome.", '"I\'ve got half a notion that Andy was telling the truth, after all,"\r\nhe remarked to Weary when they were well away from camp. "It\'s worth\r\ntaking a chance on, anyhow—and when he comes back things will be\r\nsmooth again."', 'When Saturday came and brought no Andy to camp, the Happy Family began\r\nto speculate upon his absence. When Sunday\'s circle took them within\r\ntwelve or fifteen miles of the camp in the Bad-lands, Pink suddenly\r\nproposed that they ride down there and see what was going on. "He\r\nwon\'t be looking for us," he explained, to hide a secret uneasiness.\r\n"And if he\'s there we can find out what the josh is. If he ain\'t,\r\nwe\'ll have it on him good and strong."', '"I betche Andy just wanted a lay-off, and took that way uh getting\r\nit," declared Happy Jack pessimistically. "I betche he\'s in town right\r\nnow, tearing things wide open and tickled to think he don\'t have to\r\nride in this hot sun. Yuh can\'t never tell what Andy\'s got cached up\r\nhis sleeve."', '"Chip thinks he was talking on the level," Weary mused. "Maybe he was;\r\nas Happy says, yuh can\'t tell."', 'As always before, this brought the Happy Family to argument which\r\nlasted till they neared the deep, lonely coulee where, according to\r\nAndy, "friend Dan" had wintered with the shifty-eyed old man.', '"Now, how the mischief do we get down?" questioned Jack Bates\r\ncomplainingly. "This is bound to be the right place—there\'s the cabin\r\nover there against the cottonwoods."', '"Aw, come on back," urged Happy Jack, viewing the steep bluff with\r\ndisfavor. "Chances is, Andy\'s in town right now. He ain\'t down—"', '"There\'s old Buck, over there by the creek," Pink announced. "I\'d know\r\nhim far as I could see him. Let\'s ride around that way. There\'s sure\r\nto be a trail down." He started off, and they followed him\r\ndispiritedly, for the heat was something to remember afterwards with a\r\nshudder.', '"Here\'s the place," Pink called back to them, after some minutes of\r\nriding. "Andy\'s horse is down there, too, but I don\'t see Andy—"', '"Chances is—" began Happy Jack, but found no one listening.', "It would be impossible to ride down, so they dismounted and prepared\r\nfor the scramble. They could see Buck, packed as if for the homeward\r\ntrail, and they could see Andy's horse, saddled and feeding with reins\r\ndragging. He looked up at them and whinnied, and the sound but\r\naccentuated the loneliness of the place. Buck, too, saw them and came\r\ntoward them, whinnying wistfully; but, though they strained eyes in\r\nevery direction, they could see nothing of the man they sought.", 'It was significant of their apprehension that not even Happy Jack made\r\nopen comment upon the strangeness of it. Instead, they dug bootheels\r\ndeep where the slope was loose gravel, and watched that their horses\r\ndid not slide down upon them; climbed over rocks where the way was\r\nbarred, and prayed that horse and man might not break a leg. They had\r\nbeen over rough spots, and had climbed in and out of deep coulees,\r\nbut never had they travelled a rougher trail than that.', '"My God! boys, look down there!" Pink cried, when yet fifty\r\nperpendicular feet lay between them and the level below.', 'They looked, and drew breath sharply. Huddled at the very foot of the\r\nlast and worst slope lay Andy, and they needed no words to explain\r\nwhat had happened. It was evident that he had started to climb the\r\nbluff and had slipped and fallen to the bottom, And from the way he\r\nwas lying—The Happy Family shut out the horror of the thought and\r\nhurried recklessly to the place.', 'It was Pink who, with a last slide and a stumbling recovery at the\r\nbottom, reached him first. It was Jack Bates who came a close second\r\nand helped to turn him—for he had fallen partly on his face. From the\r\nway one arm was crumpled back under him, they knew it to be broken.\r\nFurther than that they could only guess and hope. While they were\r\nfeeling for heart-beats, the others came down and crowded close. Pink\r\nlooked up at them strainedly.', '"Oh, for God\'s sake, some of yuh get water," he cried sharply. "What\r\ngood do yuh think you\'re doing, just standing around?"', '"We ought to be hung for letting him come down here alone," Weary\r\nrepented. "It ain\'t safe for one man in this cursed country. Where\'s\r\nhe hurt, Cadwolloper?"', '"How in hell do I know?" Anxiety ever sharpened the tongue of Pink.\r\n"If somebody\'d bring some water—"', '"Happy\'s gone. And there ain\'t a drop uh whisky in the crowd! Can\'t we\r\nget him into the shade? This damned sun is enough to—"', '"Look out how yuh lift him, man! You ain\'t wrassling a calf, remember!\r\nYou take his shoulder, Jack—easy, yuh damned, awkward—"', '"Here comes Happy, with his hat full. Don\'t slosh it all on at once! A\r\nlittle at a time\'s better. Get some on his head."', 'So with much incoherence and with everybody giving orders and each\r\nacting independently, they bore him tenderly into the shade of a rock\r\nand worked over him feverishly, their faces paler than his. When he\r\nopened his eyes and stared at them dully, they could have shouted for\r\nvery relief. When he closed them again they bent over him solicitously\r\nand dripped more water from the hat of Happy Jack. And not one of them\r\nbut remembered remorsefully the things they had said of him, not an\r\nhour before; the things they had said even when he was lying there\r\nalone and hurt—hurt unto death, for all they knew.', 'When he was roused enough to groan when they moved him, however\r\ngently, they began to consider the problem of getting him to camp, and\r\nthey cursed the long, hot miles that lay between. They tried to\r\nquestion him, but if he understood what they were saying he could not\r\nreply except by moaning, which was not good to hear. All that they\r\ncould gather was that when they moved his body in a certain way the\r\npain of it was unbearable. Also, he would faint when his head was\r\nlowered, or even lifted above the level. They must guard against that\r\nif they meant to get him to camp alive.', '"We\'ll have to carry him up this cussed hill, and then—If he could\r\nride at all, we might make it."', '"The chances is he\'ll die on the road," croaked Happy Jack tactlessly,\r\nand they scowled at him for voicing the fear they were trying to\r\nignore. They had been trying not to think that he might die on the\r\nroad, and they had been careful not to mention the possibility. As it\r\nwas, no one answered.', "How they ever got him to the top of that heartbreaking slope, not one\r\nof them ever knew. Twice he fainted outright. And Happy Jack,\r\ncarefully bearing his hat full of water for just that emergency,\r\nslipped and spilled the whole of it just when they needed it most. At\r\nthe last, it was as if they carried a dead man between them—Jack\r\nBates and Cal Emmett it was who bore him up the last steep climb—and\r\nPink and Weary, coming behind with all the horses, glanced fearfully\r\ninto each other's eyes and dared not question.", 'At the top they laid him down in the grass and swore at Happy Jack,\r\nbecause they must do something, and because they dared not face what\r\nmight be before them. They avoided looking at one another while they\r\nstood helplessly beside the still figure of the man they had maligned.\r\nIf he died, they would always have that bitter spot in their\r\nmemory—and even with the fear of his dying they stood remorseful.', 'Of a sudden Andy opened his eyes and looked at them with the light of\r\nrecognition, and they bent eagerly toward him. "If—yuh could—on—my\r\nhorse—I—I—could ride—maybe." Much pain it cost him, they knew by\r\nthe look on his face. But he was game to the last—just as they knew\r\nhe would be.', '"Yuh couldn\'t ride Twister, yuh know yuh couldn\'t," Pink objected\r\ngently. "But—if yuh could ride Jack\'s horse—he\'s dead gentle, and\r\nwe\'d help hold yuh on. Do you think yuh could?"', 'Andy moved his head uneasily. "I—I\'ve got to," he retorted weakly,\r\nand even essayed a smile to reassure them. "I—ain\'t all—in yet," he\r\nadded with an evident effort, and the Happy Family gulped\r\nsympathetically, and wondered secretly if they would have such nerve\r\nunder like conditions.', '"It\'s going to be one hell of a trip for yuh," Weary murmured\r\ncommiseratingly, when they were lifting him into the saddle. Of a\r\ntruth, it did seem absolutely foolhardy to attempt it, but there was\r\nnothing else to do, unless they left him there. For no wagon could\r\npossibly be driven within miles of the place.', 'Andy leaned limply over the saddle-horn, his face working with the\r\nagony he suffered. Somehow they had got him upon the horse of Jack\r\nBates, but they had felt like torturers while they did it, and the\r\nperspiration on their faces was not all caused by heat.', '"My God, I\'d rather be hung than go through this again," muttered\r\nCal, white under the tan. "I—"', '"I\'ll tackle—it now," gasped Andy, with a pitiful attempt to sit\r\nstraight in the saddle. "Get on—boys—"', 'Reluctantly they started to obey, when the horse of Jack Bates gave a\r\nsudden leap ahead. Many hands reached out to grasp him by the bridle,\r\nbut they were a shade too late, and he started to run, with Andy\r\nswaying in the saddle. While they gazed horrified, he straightened\r\nconvulsively, turned his face toward them and raised a hand; caught\r\nhis hat by the brim and swung it high above his head.', '"Much obliged, boys," he yelled derisively. "I sure do appreciate\r\nbeing packed up that hill; it was too blamed hot to walk. Say! if\r\nyou\'d gone around that bend, you\'d uh found a good trail down. Yuh\r\nstruck about the worst place there is. So-long—I ain\'t all in yet!"\r\nHe galloped away, while the Happy Family stared after him with bulging\r\neyes.', '"The son-of-a-gun!" gasped Weary weakly, and started for his horse.', '"Darn yuh, you\'ll be all in when we get hold of yuh!" screamed Jack\r\nBates, and gave chase.', 'It was when they were tearing headlong after him down the coulee\'s rim\r\nand into a shallow gully which seamed unexpectedly the level, that\r\nthey saw his horse swerve suddenly and go bounding along the edge of\r\nthe slope with Andy "sawing" energetically upon the bit.', '"What trick\'s he up to now?" cried Cal Emmett resentfully, feeling\r\nthat, in the light of what had gone before, Andy could not possibly\r\nmake a single motion in good faith.', 'Andy brought his horse under control and turned back to meet them, and\r\nthe Happy Family watched him guardedly until they reached the gulley\r\nand their own horses took fright at a dark, shambling object that\r\nscuttled away down toward the coulee-head. Andy was almost upon them\r\nbefore they could give him any attention.', '"Did you see it?" he called excitedly. "It was a bear, and he was\r\ndigging at something under that shelving rock. Come on and let\'s take\r\na look."', '"Aw, gwan!" Happy Jack adjured crossly. He was thinking of all the\r\nwater he had carried painstakingly in his hat, for the relief of this\r\nconscienceless young reprobate, and he was patently suspicious of\r\nsome new trick.', '"Well, by gracious!" Andy rode quite close—dangerously close,\r\nconsidering the mood they were in—and eyed them queerly. "I sure must\r\nhave a horrible rep, when yuh won\'t believe your own eyes just because\r\nI happen to remark that a bear is a bear. I\'ll call it a pinto hog, if\r\nit\'ll make yuh feel any better. And I\'ll say it wasn\'t doing any\r\ndigging; only, I\'m going down there and take a look. There\'s an\r\nodor—"', 'There was, and they could not deny it, even though Andy did make the\r\nassertion. And though they had threatened much that was exceedingly\r\nunpleasant, and what they would surely do to Andy if they ever got him\r\nwithin reach, they followed him quite peaceably.', "They saw him get off his horse and stand looking down at\r\nsomething—and there was that in his attitude which made them jab\r\nspurs against their horses' flanks. A moment later they, too, were\r\nlooking down at something, and they were not saying a word.", '"It\'s Dan, all right," said Andy at last, and his tone was hushed. "I\r\nhunted the coulee over—every foot of it—and looked up some of the\r\nlittle draws, and went along the river; but I couldn\'t find any trace\r\nof him. I never thought about coming up here.', '"Look there. His head was smashed in with a rock or something—ugh!\r\nHere, let me away, boys.', 'This thing—" He walked uncertainly away and sat down upon a rock with\r\nhis face in his hands, and what they could see of his face was as\r\nwhite as the tan would permit. Somehow, not a man of them doubted him\r\nthen. And not a man of them but felt much the same. They backed away\r\nand stood close to where Andy was sitting.', '"You wouldn\'t believe me when I told yuh," he reproached, when the\r\nsickness had passed and he could lift his head and look at them. "You\r\nthought I was lying, and yuh made yourselves pretty blamed obnoxious\r\nto me—but I got even for that." There was much satisfaction in his\r\ntone, and the Happy Family squirmed. "Yuh see, I was telling the\r\ntruth, all right—and now I\'m going to get even some more. I\'m going\r\nto take—er—Pink along for a witness, and notify the outfit that yuh\r\nwon\'t be back for a day or two, and send word to the sheriff. And you\r\njaspers can have the pleasure uh standing guard over—that." He\r\nshivered a little and turned his glance quickly away. "And I hope," he\r\nadded maliciously, as he mounted his own horse, "you\'ll make Jack\r\nBates stand an all-night guard by his high lonesome. He\'s sure got it\r\ncoming to him!"', 'With Pink following close at his heels he rode away up the ridge.', '"Say, there\'s grub enough on old Buck to do yuh to-night," he called\r\ndown to them, "in case Chip don\'t send yuh any till to-morrow." He\r\nwaved a subdued farewell and turned his face again up the ridge, and\r\nbefore they had quite decided what to do about it, he was gone.', 'Andy Green, of the Flying U, loped over the grassy level and hummed a\r\ntune as he rode. The sun shone just warm enough to make a man feel\r\nthat the world was good enough for him, and the wind was just a lazy,\r\nwhispering element to keep the air from growing absolutely still and\r\nstagnant. There was blue sky with white, fluffy bits of cloud like\r\ntorn cotton drifting as lazily as the wind, and there were\r\nmeadow-larks singing and swaying, and slow-moving range cattle with\r\ntheir calves midway to weaning time. Not often may one ride leisurely\r\nafar on so perfect a day, and while Andy was a sunny-natured fellow at\r\nall times, on such a day he owned not a care.', 'A mile farther, and he rode over a low shoulder of the butte he was\r\npassing, ambled down the long slope on the far side, crossed another\r\nrounded hill, followed down a dry creek-bed at the foot of it, sought\r\nwith his eye for a practicable crossing and went headlong down a\r\nsteep, twenty-foot bank; rattled the loose rocks in the dry, narrow\r\nchannel and went forging up a bank steeper than the first, with\r\ncreaking saddle-leather and grunting horse, and struck again easy\r\ngoing.', '"She slipped on me," he murmured easily, meaning the saddle. "I\'m\r\nriding on your tail, just about; but I guess we can stand it the rest\r\nuh the why, all right." If he had not been so lazy and self-satisfied\r\nhe would have stopped right there and reset the saddle. But if he had,\r\nhe might have missed something which he liked to live over o\' nights.', 'He went up a gentle rise, riding slowly because of the saddle, passed\r\nover the ridge and went down another short slope. At the foot of the\r\nslope, cuddled against another hill, stood a low, sod-roofed cabin\r\nwith rusty stove-pipe rising aslant from one corner. This was the spot\r\nhe had been aiming for, and he neared it slowly.', 'It was like a dozen other log cabins tucked away here and there among\r\nthe foothills of the Bear Paws. It had an air of rakish hominess, as\r\nif it would be a fine, snuggy place in winter, when the snow and the\r\nwind swept the barren land around. In the summer, it stood open-doored\r\nand open-windowed, with all the litter of bachelor belongings\r\nscattered about or hanging from pegs on the wall outside. There was a\r\nfaint trail of smoke from the rusty pipe, and it brought a grunt of\r\nsatisfaction from Andy.', '"He\'s home, all right. And if he don\'t throw together some uh them\r\nsour-dough biscuits uh his, there\'ll be something happen! Hope the\r\nbean-pot\'s full. G\'wan, yuh lazy old skate." He slapped the rein-ends\r\nlightly down the flanks of his horse and went at a trot around the end\r\nof the cabin. And there he was so utterly taken by surprise that he\r\nalmost pulled his mount into a sitting posture.', 'A young woman was stooping before the open door, and she was pouring\r\nsomething from a white earthen bowl into a battered tin pan. Two\r\nwaggle-tailed lambs—a black one and a white—were standing on their\r\nknees in their absorption, and were noisily drinking of the stuff as\r\nfast as it came within reach.', 'Andy had half a minute in which to gaze before the young woman looked\r\nup, said "Oh!" in a breathless sort of way and retreated to the\r\ndoorstep, where she stood regarding him inquiringly.', 'Andy, feeling his face go unreasonably red, lifted his hat. He knew\r\nthat she was waiting for him to speak, but he could not well say any\r\nof the things he thought, and blurted out an utterly idiotic question.', '"What are yuh feeding \'em?"', 'The girl looked down at the bowl in her hands and laughed a little.', '"Rolled oats," she answered, "boiled very thin and with condensed\r\ncream added to taste. Good morning." She seemed about to disappear,\r\nand that brought Andy to his senses. He was not, as a rule, a bashful\r\nyoung man.', '"Good morning. Is—er—Mr. Johnson at home?" He came near saying\r\n"Take-Notice," but caught himself in time. Take-Notice Johnson was\r\nwhat men called the man whom Andy had ridden over to see upon a more\r\nor less trivial matter.', '"He isn\'t, but he will be back—if you care to wait." She spoke with a\r\ncertain preciseness which might be natural or artificial, and she\r\nstood in the doorway with no symptoms of immediate disappearance.', 'Andy slid over a bit in the saddle, readjusted his hat so that its\r\nbrim would shield his eyes from the sunlight, and prepared to be\r\nfriendly. "Oh, I\'ll wait," he said easily. "I\'ve got all the time\r\nthere is. Would you mind if I smoked a cigarette?"', '"Indeed, I was wishing you would," she told him, with surprising\r\nfrankness. "I\'ve so longed to see a dashing young cowboy roll a\r\ncigarette with deft, white fingers."', 'Andy, glancing at her startled, spilled much tobacco down the front of\r\nhim, stopped to brush it away and let the lazy breeze snatch the tiny\r\noblong of paper from between his unwatchful fingers. Of course, she\r\nwas joshing him, he thought uneasily, as he separated the leaves of\r\nhis cigarette book by blowing gently upon them, and singled out\r\nanother paper. "Are yuh so new to the country that it\'s anything of a\r\ntreat?" he asked guardedly.', '"Yes, I\'m new. I\'m what you people call a pilgrim. Don\'t you do it\r\nwith one hand? I thought—oh, yes! You hold the reins between your\r\nfirm, white teeth while you roll—"', '"Lady, I never travelled with no show," Andy protested mildly and\r\nuntruthfully. Was she just joshing? Or didn\'t she know any better?\r\nShe looked sober as anything, but somehow her eyes kind of—', '"You see, I know some things about you. Those are chaps" (Heavens!\r\nShe called them the way they are spelled, without the soft sound of\r\ns!) "That you\'re wearing for—trousers" (Andy blushed modestly. He was\r\nnot wearing them "for trousers".), "and you\'ve got jingling rowels at\r\nyour heels, and those are taps—"', '"You\'re going to be shy a yard or two of calico if that black\r\nlamb-critter has his say-so," Andy cut in remorselessly, and hastily\r\nmade and lighted his cigarette while she was rescuing her blue calico\r\nskirt from the jaws of the black lamb and puckering her eyebrows over\r\nthe chewed place. When her attention was once more given to him, he\r\nwas smoking as unobtrusively as possible, and he was gazing at her\r\nwith a good deal of speculative admiration. He looked hastily down at\r\nthe lambs. "Mary had two little lambs," he murmured inanely.', '"They\'re not mine," she informed him, taking him seriously—or seeming\r\nto do so. Andy had some trouble deciding just how much of her was\r\nsincere. "They were here when I came, and I can\'t take them back with\r\nme, so there\'s no use in claiming them. They\'d be such a nuisance on\r\nthe train—"', '"I reckon they would," Andy agreed, "if yuh had far to go."', '"Well, you can\'t call San Jose close," she observed, meditatively.\r\n"It takes four days to come."', '"You\'re a long way from home. Does it—are yuh homesick, ever?" Andy\r\nwas playing for information without asking directly how long she\r\nintended to stay—a question which had suddenly seemed quite\r\nimportant. Also, why was she stopping here with Take-Notice Johnson,\r\naway off from everybody?', '"Seeing I\'ve only been here four days, the novelty hasn\'t worn off\r\nyet," she replied. "But it does seem more like four weeks; and how\r\nI\'ll ever stand two months of it, not ever seeing a soul but father—"', "Andy looked reproachful, and also glad. Didn't she consider him a\r\nsoul? And Take-Notice was her dad! To be sure, Take-Notice had never\r\nmentioned having a daughter, but then, in the range-land, men don't go\r\naround yawping their personal affairs.", 'Before Take-Notice returned, Andy felt that he had accomplished much.\r\nHe had learned that the young woman\'s name really was Mary, and that\r\nshe was a stenographer in a real-estate office in San Jose, where her\r\nmother lived; that the confinement of office-work had threatened her\r\nwith pulmonary tuberculosis (Andy failed, at the moment, to recognize\r\nthe disease which had once threatened him also, and wondered vaguely)\r\nand that the doctor had advised her coming to Montana for a couple of\r\nmonths; that she had written to her father (it seemed queer to have\r\nanyone speak of old Take-Notice as "father") and that he had told her\r\nto "come a-running."', 'She told Andy that she had not seen her father for five years (Andy\r\nknew that Take-Notice had disappeared for a whole winter, about that\r\nlong ago, and that no one had discovered where he went) because he and\r\nher mother were "not congenial."', 'He had dismounted, at her invitation, and had gone clanking to the\r\ndoorstep and sat down—giving a furtive kick now and then at the black\r\nlamb, which developed a fondness for the leathern fringe on his\r\nchaps—and had eaten an orange which she had brought in her trunk all\r\nthe way from San Jose, and which she had picked from a tree which\r\nstood by her mother\'s front gate. He had nibbled a ripe olive—eating\r\nit with what Andy himself would term "long teeth"—and had tried hard\r\nnot to show how vile he found it. He had inspected two star-fishes\r\nwhich she had found last Fourth-of-July at Monterey and had dried; and\r\nhad crumpled a withered leaf of bay in his hands and had smelled and\r\nnearly sneezed his head off; and had cracked and eaten four\r\nwalnuts—also gathered from her mother\'s yard—and three almonds from\r\nthe same source, and had stared admiringly at a note-book filled with\r\nfunny marks which she called shorthand.', 'Between-whiles Andy had told her his name and the name of the outfit\r\nhe worked for; had explained what he meant by "outfit," and had drawn\r\na large U in the dirt to show her what a Flying U was, and had wanted\r\nto murder the black lamb which kept getting in his way and trying to\r\neat the stick Andy used for a pencil; had confessed that he did\r\nsometimes play cards for money, as do the cowboys in Western stories,\r\nbut assured her that he had never killed off any of his friends during\r\nany little disagreement. He had owned to drinking a glass of whisky\r\nnow and then, but declared that it was only for snake bite and did not\r\nhappen oftener than once in six months or so. Yes, he had often had\r\nrattlers in his bed, but not to hurt. This is where he began to\r\ninspect the star-fishes, and so turned the conversation safely back to\r\nCalifornia and himself away from the temptation to revel in fiction.', 'All of which took time, so that Take-Notice came before they quite\r\nfelt a longing for his presence; and though the sun shone straight in\r\nthe cabin door and so proved that it was full noon, there was no fire\r\nleft in the stove and nothing in sight that was eatable save another\r\nripe olive—which Andy had politely declined—and two more almonds and\r\nan orange.', 'A stenographer, with a fluffy pompadour that dipped distractingly at\r\none side, and a gold watch suspended around the neck like a locket,\r\nand with sleeves that came no farther than the elbow and heels higher\r\nthan any riding boot Andy ever owned in his life, and with teeth that\r\nwere very white and showed a glint of gold here and there, and eyes\r\nthat looked at one with insincere gravity, and fingers with nails that\r\nshone—fingers that pinched red lips together meditatively—a\r\nstenographer who has all these entrancing attributes, Andy discovered,\r\nmay yet lack those housewifely accomplishments that make a man dream\r\nof a little home for two. So far as Andy could see, her knowledge of\r\ncookery extended no farther than rolled oat porridge for the two\r\nlambs.', 'Take-Notice it was who whittled shavings and started the fire without\r\nany comment upon the hour or his appetite; who went to the spring and\r\nbrought water, half-filled the enameled teakettle which had large,\r\nbare patches where the enamel had been chipped off in the stress of\r\nbaching, and sliced the bacon and mixed the "sour-dough" biscuits. To\r\nbe sure, he had done those things for years and thought nothing of it;\r\nAndy, also, had done those things, many\'s the time, and had thought\r\nnothing of it, either. But to do them while a young woman sits calmly\r\nby and makes no offer of help, but talks of many things, unconscious\r\neven of her world-old, feminine duties and privileges, that struck\r\nAndy with a cold breath of disillusionment.', 'He watched her unobtrusively while she talked. She never once seemed\r\nto feel that cooking belonged to woman, and as far as he could see\r\nTake-Notice did not feel so either. So Andy mentally adjusted himself\r\nto the novelty and joyed in her presence.', 'To show how successful was his mental adjustment, it is necessary\r\nmerely to state one fact: Where he had intended to stop an hour or so,\r\nhe stayed the afternoon; ate supper there and rode home at sundown,\r\nhis mind a jumble of sunny Californian days where one may gather\r\nstar-fishes and oranges, bay leaves and ripe olives at will, and of\r\nblack and white lambs which always obtrude themselves at the wrong\r\nmoment and break off little, intimate confidences about life in a\r\nreal-estate office, perhaps; and of polished finger-nails that never\r\ndip themselves in dishwater—Andy had come to believe that it would be\r\nneither right or just to expect them to do so common a thing.', 'The season was what the range calls "between roundups," so that Andy\r\nwent straight to the ranch and found the Happy Family in or around the\r\nbunk-house, peacefully enjoying their before-bedtime smoke. Andy,\r\namong other positive faults and virtues, did not lack a certain degree\r\nof guile. Men there were at the Flying U who would ride in haste if\r\nthey guessed that a pompadoured young woman from California was at the\r\nend of the trail, and Andy, knowing well the reputation he bore among\r\nthem, set that reputation at work to keep the trail empty of all\r\nriders save himself. When someone asked him idly what had kept him so\r\nlong, he gazed around at them with his big, innocent gray eyes.', '"Why, I was just getting acquainted with the new girl," he answered\r\nsimply and truthfully.', 'Truth being something which the Happy Family was unaccustomed to from\r\nthe lips of Andy Green, they sniffed scornfully.', '"What girl?" demanded Irish bluntly.', '"Why, Take-Notice\'s girl. His young lady daughter that is visiting\r\nhim. She\'s mighty nice, and she\'s got style about her, and she was\r\nfeeding two lambs. Her name," he added softly, "is Mary."', 'Since no one had ever heard that Take-Notice had a daughter, the Happy\r\nFamily could not be blamed for doubting Andy. They did doubt,\r\nprofanely and volubly.', '"Say, did any of you fellows ever eat a ripe olive?" Andy broke in,\r\nwhen he could make himself heard. "Well," he explained mildly, when\r\ncame another rift of silence in the storm-cloud of words, "When yuh\r\nride over there, she\'ll likely give yuh one to try; but yuh take my\r\nadvice and pass it up. I went up against one, and I ain\'t got the\r\ntaste out uh my mouth yet. It\'s sure fierce."', "More words, from which Andy gathered that they did not believe\r\nanything he said; that he was wasting time and breath, and that his\r\nimagination was weak and his lies idiotic. He'd better not let\r\nTake-Notice hear how he was taking his name in vain and giving him a\r\ndaughter—and so on.", '"Say, did yuh ever see a star-fish? Funniest thing yuh ever saw, all\r\npimply, and pink, and with five points to \'em. She\'s got two. When yuh\r\ngo over, you ask her to let yuh see \'em." Andy was in bed, then, and\r\nhe spoke through the dusk toward the voices. What those voices had\r\njust then been saying seemed to have absolutely no effect upon him.', '"Oh, dry up!" Irish commanded impatiently. "Nobody\'s thinking uh\r\nriding over there, yuh chump. What kind of easy marks do yuh think we\r\nare?"', 'Andy laughed audibly in his corner next the window. "Say, you fellows\r\ndo amuse me a lot. By gracious, I\'ll bet five dollars some of yuh take\r\nthe trail over there, soon or late. I—I\'ll bet five dollars to one\r\nthat yuh do! The bet to hold good for —well, say six weeks. But yuh\r\nbetter not take me up, boys—especially Irish, that ain\'t got a girl\r\nat present. Yes, or any of yuh, by gracious! It\'ll be a case for\r\nbreach-uh-promise for any one uh yuh. Say, she\'s a bird! Got goldy\r\nhair, and a dimple in her chin and eyes that\'d make a man—"', "With much reviling they accepted the wager, and after that Andy went\r\npeacefully to sleep, quite satisfied for the time with the effect\r\nproduced by his absolute truthfulness; it did not matter much, he told\r\nhimself complacently, what a man's reputation might be, so long as he\r\nrecognized its possibilities and shaped his actions properly.", "It is true that when he returned from Dry Lake, not many days after,\r\nwith a package containing four new ties and a large, lustrous silk\r\nhandkerchief of the proper, creamy tint, the Happy Family seemed to\r\nwaver a bit. When he took to shaving every other day, and became\r\nextremely fastidious about his finger-nails and his boots and the knot\r\nin his tie, and when he polished the rowels of his spurs with Patsy's\r\nscouring brick (which Patsy never used) and was careful to dent his\r\nhat-crown into four mathematically correct dimples before ever he\r\nwould ride away from the ranch, the Happy Family looked thoughtful\r\nand discussed him privately in low tones.", "But when Andy smilingly assured them that he was going over to call on\r\nTake-Notice's girl, and asked them if they wouldn't like to come along\r\nand be introduced, and taste a ripe olive, and look at the\r\nstar-fishes, and smell a crumpled leaf of bay, they backed\r\nfiguratively from the wiles of him and asserted more or less\r\nemphatically he couldn't work them. Then Andy would grin and ride\r\ngaily away, and Flying U Coulee would see him no more for several\r\nhours. It was mere good fortune—from Andy's viewpoint—that duty did\r\nnot immediately call the Happy Family, singly or as a whole, to ride\r\nacross the hills toward the cabin of Take-Notice Johnson. Without a\r\nlegitimate excuse, he felt sure of their absence from the place, and\r\nhe also counted optimistically upon their refusing to ask any one whom\r\nthey might meet, if Take-Notice Johnson had a daughter visiting him.", 'Four weeks do not take much space in a calendar, nor much time to\r\nlive; yet in the four that came just after Andy\'s discovery, he\r\naccomplished much, even in his own modest reckoning. He had taught the\r\ngirl to watch for his coming and to stand pensively in the door with\r\nmany good-bye messages when he said he must hit the trail. He had\r\nformed definite plans for the future and had promised her quite\r\nseriously that he would cut out gambling, and never touch liquor in\r\nany form—unless the snake was a very big one and sunk his fangs in\r\na vital spot, in which dire contingency Mary absolved him from his\r\nvow. He had learned the funny marks that meant his name and hers in\r\nshorthand and had watched with inner satisfaction her efforts to learn\r\nhow to fry canned corn in bacon grease, and to mix sour-dough biscuits\r\nthat were neither yellow with too much soda nor distressfully "soggy"\r\nwith too little, and had sat a whole, blissful afternoon in his\r\nshirtsleeves, while Mary bent her blond pompadour domestically over\r\nhis coat, sewing in the sleeve-linings that are prone to come loose\r\nand torment a man. To go back to the first statement, which includes\r\nall these things and much more, Andy had, in those four weeks,\r\naccomplished much.', 'But a girl may not live forever in that lonely land with only Andy\r\nGreen to discover her presence, and the rumors which at first buzzed\r\nunheeded in the ears of the Happy Family, stung them at last to the\r\npoint of investigation; so that on a Sunday—the last Sunday before\r\nthe Flying U wagons took again to the trailless range-land, Irish and\r\nJack Bates rode surreptitiously up the coulee half an hour after Andy,\r\nblithe in his fancied security, had galloped that way to spend a long\r\nhalf-day with Mary. If he discovered them they would lose a dollar\r\neach—but if they discovered a girl such as Andy had pictured, they\r\nfelt that it would be a dollar well lost.', 'In the range-land many strange things may happen. Irish and Jack\r\npulled up short when, off to their right, in a particularly, lonely\r\npart of that country, broken into seamed coulees and deep-scarred\r\nhills, they heard a faint halloo. With spurs pricking deep and\r\nfrequent they hurried to the spot; looked down a grassy swale and saw\r\nAndy lying full length upon the ground in rather a peculiar pose,\r\nwhile his horse fed calmly a rein-length away.', 'They stopped and looked at him, and at each other; rode cautiously to\r\nwithin easy rifle shot and stopped again.', '"Ain\'t yuh getting tired feelings kinda unseasonable in the day?" Jack\r\nBates called out guardedly.', '"I—I\'m hurt, boys," Andy lifted his head to say, strainedly. "My\r\nhoss stepped in a hole, and I wasn\'t looking for it. I guess—my leg\'s\r\nbroke."', 'Jack snorted. "That so? Sure it ain\'t your neck, now? Seems to me your\r\nhead sets kinda crooked. Better feel it and find out, while we go on\r\nwhere we\'re going." He half turned his horse up the hill again,\r\nresenting the impulse which had betrayed him a hand\'s breadth from the\r\ntrail.', 'Andy waited a moment. Then: "On the dead, boys, my leg\'s broke—like\r\nyou\'d bust a dry stick. Come and see—for yourselves."', '"Maybe—" Irish began, uncertainly, in an undertone. Andy\'s voice had\r\nin it a note of pain that was rather convincing.', '"Aw, he\'s just trying to head us off. Didn\'t I help pack him up that\r\nungodly bluff, last spring, thinking he was going to die before we got\r\nhim to the top—and him riding off and giving us the horse-laugh to\r\npay for it? You can bite, if yuh want to; I\'m going on. I sure savvy\r\nAndy Green."', '"Come and look," Andy begged from below. "If I\'m joshing—"', '"You can josh and be darned," finished Jack for him. "I don\'t pack you\r\nup hill more than once, old-timer. We\'re going to call on your\r\nMary-girl. When yuh get good and refreshed up, you can come and look\r\non at me and Irish acting pretty and getting a stand-in. So-long!"', 'Irish, looking back over his shoulder, saw Andy raise his head and\r\ngaze after them; saw it drop upon his arms just before they went quite\r\nover the hill. The sight stuck persistently and unpleasantly in his\r\nmemory.', '"Yuh know, he might be hurt," he began tentatively when they had\r\nridden slowly a hundred yards or so.', '"He might. But he ain\'t. He\'s up to some game again, and he wouldn\'t\r\nlike anything better than to have us ride down there and feel his\r\nbones. If you\'d been along, that day in the Bad-lands, you\'d know the\r\nkind of bluff he can put up. Why, we all thought sure he was going to\r\ndie. He acted that natural we felt like we was packing a corpse at a\r\nfuneral—and him tickled to death all the while at the load he was\r\nthrowing! No sir, yuh don\'t see me swallowing no such dope as that,\r\nany more. When he gets tired uh laying there, he\'ll recover rapid and\r\ncome on. Don\'t yuh worry none about Andy Green; why, man, do yuh\r\nreckon any horse-critter could break his leg—a rider like him? He\r\nknows more ways uh falling off a horse without losing the ashes off\r\nhis cigarette than most men know how to—how to punish grub! Andy\r\nGreen couldn\'t get hurt with a horse! If he could, he\'d uh been dead\r\nand playing his little harp long ago."', "Such an argument was more convincing than the note of pain in the\r\nvoice of Andy, so that Irish shook off his uneasiness and laughed at\r\nthe narrow escape he'd had from being made a fool. And speedily they\r\nforgot the incident.", 'It was Take-Notice who made them remember, when they had been an hour\r\nor so basking themselves, so to speak, in the smiles of Mary. They had\r\nfancied all along that she had a curiously expectant air, and that she\r\nwent very often to the door to see what the lambs were up to—and\r\nalways lifted her eyes to the prairie slope down which they had ridden\r\nand gazed as long as she dared. They were not dull; they understood\r\nquite well what "lamb" it was that held half the mind of her, and they\r\nwere piqued because of their understanding, and not disposed to\r\nfurther the cause of the absent. Therefore, when Take-Notice asked\r\ncasually what had become of Andy, Jack Bates moved his feet\r\nimpatiently, shot a sidelong glance at the girl (who was at that\r\nmoment standing where she could look out of the window) and laughed\r\nunpleasantly.', '"Oh, Andy\'s been took again with an attack uh bluff," he answered\r\nlightly. "He gets that way, ever so often, you know. We left him\r\nlaying in a sunny spot, a few miles back, trying to make somebody\r\nthink he was hurt, so they\'d pack him home and he\'d have the laugh on\r\nthem for all summer."', '"Wasn\'t he hurt?" The girl turned suddenly and her voice told how much\r\nit meant to her. But Jack was not sympathetic.', '"No, he wasn\'t hurt. He was just playing off. He got us once, that\r\nway, and he\'s never given up the notion that he could do it again. We\r\nmay be easy, but—"', '"I don\'t understand," the girl broke in sharply. "Do you mean that he\r\nwould deliberately try to deceive you into believing he was hurt, when\r\nhe wasn\'t?"', '"Miss Johnson," Jack replied sorrowfully, "he would. He would lose\r\nvaluable sleep for a month, studying up the smoothest way to deceive.\r\nI guess," he added artfully, and as if the subject was nearly\r\nexhausted, "yuh don\'t know Mr. Green very well."', '"I remember hearing about that job he put up on yuh," Take-Notice\r\nremarked, not noticing that the girl\'s lips were opened for speech,\r\n"Yuh made a stretcher, didn\'t yuh, and—"', '"No—he told it that way, but he\'s such a liar he couldn\'t tell the\r\ntruth if he wanted to. We found him lying at the bottom of a steep\r\nbluff, and he appeared to be about dead. It looked as if he\'d slipped\r\nand fallen down part way. So we packed water and sloshed in his face,\r\nand he kinda come to, and then we packed him up the bluff—and yuh\r\nknow what the Bad-lands is like, Take-Notice. It was unmerciful hot,\r\ntoo, and we like to died getting him up. At the top we laid him down\r\nand worked over him till we got him to open his eyes, and he could\r\ntalk a little and said maybe he could ride if we could get him on a\r\nhorse. The—he made us lift him into the saddle—and considering the\r\nsize of him, it was something of a contract—and then he made as if he\r\ncouldn\'t stay on, even. But first we knew he digs in the spurs, yanks\r\noff his hat and lets a yell out of him you could hear a mile, and\r\nsays: \'Much obliged, boys, it was too blamed hot to walk up that\r\nhill,\' and off he goes."', 'Take-Notice stretched his legs out before him, pushed his hands deep\r\ndown in his trousers\' pockets, and laughed and laughed. "That was sure\r\none on you," he chuckled. "Andy\'s a hard case, all right."', 'But the girl stood before him, a little pale and with her chin high.\r\n"Father, how can you think it\'s funny?" she cried impatiently. "It\r\nseems to me—er—I think it\'s perfectly horrid for a man to act like\r\nthat. And you say, Mr. Bates, that he\'s out there now"—she swept a\r\nvery pretty hand and arm toward the window—"acting the same silly\r\nsort of falsehood?"', '"I don\'t know where he is now," Jack answered judicially. "That\'s\r\nwhat he was doing when we came past."', 'She went to the door and stood looking vaguely out at nothing in\r\nparticular, and Irish took the opportunity to kick Jack on the\r\nankle-bone and viciously whisper, "Yuh damned chump!" But Jack smiled\r\nserenely. Irish, he reflected, had not been with them that day in the\r\nBad-lands, and so had not the same cause for vengeance. He remembered\r\nthat Irish had laughed, just as Take-Notice was laughing, when they\r\ntold him about it; but Jack had never been able to see the joke, and\r\nhis conscience did not trouble him now.', 'More they said about Andy Green—he and Take-Notice, with Irish\r\nmostly silent and with the girl extremely indignant at times and at\r\nothers slightly incredulous, but always eager to hear more. More they\r\nsaid, not with malice, perhaps, for they liked Andy Green, but with\r\nthe spirit of reminiscence strong upon them. Many things that he had\r\nsaid and done they recalled and laughed over—but the girl did not\r\nlaugh. At sundown, when they rode away, she scribbled a hasty note,\r\nput it in an envelope and entrusted it to Irish for immediate delivery\r\nto the absent and erring one. Then they rode home, promising each\r\nother that they would sure devil Andy to death when they saw him, and\r\nwishing that they had ridden long ago to the cabin of Take-Notice. It\r\nwas not pleasant to know that Andy Green had again fooled them\r\ncompletely.', 'None at the ranch had seen Andy, and they speculated much upon the\r\nnature of the game he was playing. Happy Jack wanted to bet that Andy\r\nreally had broken his leg—but that was because he had a present\r\ngrievance against Irish and hated to agree with anything he said. But\r\nwhen they went to bed, the Happy Family had settled unanimously upon\r\nthe theory that Andy had ridden to Dry Lake, and would come loping\r\nserenely down the trail next day.', 'Irish did not know what time it was when he found himself sitting up\r\nin bed listening, but he discovered Pink getting quietly into his\r\nclothes. Irish hesitated a moment, and then felt under his pillow for\r\nhis own garments—long habit had made him put them there—and began to\r\ndress. "I guess I\'ll go along with yuh," he whispered.', '"Yuh can if yuh want to," Pink answered ungraciously. "But yuh needn\'t\r\nraise the long howl if—"', '"Hold on, boys; my ante\'s on the table," came guardedly from Weary\'s\r\nbunk, and there was a soft, shuffling sound as of moving blankets; the\r\nsubdued scrape of boots pulled from under bunks, and the quiet\r\nsearching for hats and gloves. There was a clank of spur-chains, the\r\nfaint squeal of a hinge gone rusty, a creak of a loose board, and then\r\nthe three stood together outside under the star-sprinkle and avoided\r\nlooking at one another. Without a word they went down the deep-worn\r\npath to the big gate, swung it open and headed for the corral where\r\nslept their horses.', '"If them bone-heads don\'t wake up, nobody\'ll be any the wiser—and\r\nit\'s a lovely night for a ramble," murmured Weary, consoling himself.', '"Well, I couldn\'t sleep," Irish confessed, half defiantly. "I expect\r\nit\'s just a big josh, but—it won\'t do any hurt to make sure."', '"Yuh all think Andy Green lives to tell lies," snapped Pink, throwing\r\nthe saddle on his horse with a grunt at the weight of it. The horse\r\nflinched away from its impact, and Pink swore at it viciously. "Yuh\r\nmight uh gone down and made sure, anyhow," he criticised.', '"Well, I was going to; but Jack said—" Irish stooped to pick up the\r\nlatigo and did not finish. "But I can\'t get over the way his head\r\ndropped down on his arms, when we were riding out uh sight. As if—oh,\r\nhell! If it was a josh, I\'ll just about beat the head off him for\r\nspoiling my sleep this way. Get your foot off that rein, yuh damned,\r\nclumsy bench!" This last to his horse.', 'They rode slowly away from the ranch and made the greater haste when\r\nthe sound of their galloping could not reach the dulled ears of those\r\nwho slept. They did not talk much, and when they did it was to tell\r\none another what great fools they were—but even in the telling they\r\nurged their horses to greater speed.', '"Well," Pink summed up at last, "if he\'s hurt, out here, we\'re doing\r\nthe right thing; and if he ain\'t, he won\'t be there to have the laugh\r\non us; so it\'s all right either way."', 'There was black shadow in the grassy swale where they found him. His\r\nhorse had wandered off and it was only the sure instinct of Irish that\r\nled them to the spot where he lay, a blacker shadow in the darkness\r\nthat a passing cloud had made. Just at first they thought him dead,\r\nbut when they lifted him he groaned and then spoke.', '"It\'s one on me, this time," he said, and the throat of Irish pinched\r\nachingly together at the sound of his voice, which had in it the note\r\nof pain he had been trying to forget.', 'After that he said nothing at all, because he was a senseless weight\r\nin their arms.', 'At daylight Irish was pounding vehemently the door of the White House\r\nand calling for the Little Doctor. Andy lay stretched unconscious upon\r\nthe porch beside him, and down in the bunk-house the Happy Family was\r\nrubbing eyes and exclaiming profanely at the story Pink was telling.', '"And here," finished Irish a couple of hours later, when he was\r\ntalking the thing over with the Little Doctor, "here\'s a note\r\nTake-Notice\'s girl gave me for him. I don\'t reckon there\'s any good\r\nnews in it, so maybe yuh better hold it out on him till he\'s got over\r\nthe fever. I guess we queered Andy a lot—but I\'ll ride over, soon as\r\nI can, and fix it up with her and tell her he broke his leg, all\r\nright. Maybe," he finished optimistically, "she\'ll come over to see\r\nhim."', 'Irish kept his word, though he delayed until the next day; and the\r\nnext day it was too late. For the cabin of Take-Notice was closed and\r\nempty, and the black lamb and the white were nosing unhappily their\r\nover-turned pan of mush, and bleating lonesomely. Irish waited a while\r\nand started home again; rode into the trail and met Bert Rogers, who\r\nexplained:', '"Take-Notice was hauling his girl, trunk and all, to the depot," he\r\ntold Irish. "I met \'em just this side the lane. They aimed to catch\r\nthe afternoon train, I reckon. She was going home, Take-Notice told\r\nme."', 'So Irish rode thoughtfully back to the ranch and went straight to the\r\nWhite House where Andy lay, meaning to break the news as carefully as\r\nhe knew how.', 'Andy was lying in bed looking big-eyed at the ceiling, and in his hand\r\nwas the note. He turned his head and glanced indifferently at Irish.', '"Yuh sure made a good job of it, didn\'t yuh?" he began calmly, though\r\nit was not the calm which meant peace. "I was just about engaged to\r\nthat girl. If it\'ll do yuh any good to know how nice and thorough yuh\r\nbusted everything up for me, read that." He held out the paper, and\r\nIrish turned a guilty red when he took it.', '"Mr. Green: I have just been greatly entertained with the history\r\n  of your very peculiar deeds and adventures, and I wish to say that\r\n  I have discovered myself wholly lacking the sense of humor which\r\n  is necessary to appreciate you.', '  "As I am going home to-morrow, this is my only opportunity of\r\n  letting you know how thoroughly I detest falsehood in any form.\r\n  Yours truly,', '"MARY EDITH JOHNSON."', '"Ain\'t yuh proud?" Andy inquired in a peculiar, tired voice. "Maybe\r\nI\'m a horrible liar, all right—but I never done anybody a dirty trick\r\nlike that."', 'Irish might have said it was Jack Bates who did the mischief, but he\r\ndid not. "We never knew it was anything serious," he explained\r\ncontritely. "On the dead, I\'m sorry—"', '"And that does a damned lot uh good—if she\'s gone!" Andy cut in,\r\nmiserably.', '"Oh, she\'s gone, all right. She went to-day," murmured Irish, and went\r\nout and shut the door softly behind him.', 'Andy Green, unshaven as to face and haggard as to eyes, leaned upon\r\nhis stout, willow stick and looked gloomily away to the west. He was a\r\ngood deal given to looking to the west, these days when a leg\r\nnew-healed kept him at the ranch, though habit and inclination would\r\nhave sent him riding fast and far over prairies untamed. Inaction\r\ncomes hard when a man has lived his life mostly in the open, doing\r\nthose things which keep brain and muscle keyed alike to alertness and\r\nleave no time for brooding.', 'If Andy had not broken his leg but had gone with the others on\r\nroundup, he would never have spent the days glooming unavailingly\r\nbecause a girl with a blond pompadour and teasing eyes had gone away\r\nand taken with her a false impression of his morals, and left behind\r\nher the sting of a harsh judgment against which there seemed no\r\nappeal. As it was, he spent the time going carefully over his past in\r\nself-justification, and in remembering every moment that he had spent\r\nwith Mary Johnson in those four weeks when she stayed with her father\r\nand petted the black lamb and the white.', 'In his prejudiced view, he had never done anything to make a girl hate\r\nhim. He had not always told the truth—he would admit that with\r\ncandid, gray eyes looking straight into your own—but he had never\r\nlied to harm a man, which, it seemed to him, makes all the difference\r\nin the world.', 'If he could once have told her how he felt about it, and showed her\r\nhow the wide West breeds wider morals—he did not quite know how you\r\nwould put these things, but he felt them very keenly. He wanted to\r\nmake her feel the difference; to see that little things do not count\r\nin a man\'s life, after all, except when they affect him as a man when\r\nbig things are wanted of him. A little cowardice would count, for\r\ninstance, because it would show that the man would fail at the test;\r\nbut a little lie? just a harmless sort of lie that was only a "josh"\r\nand was taken as such by one\'s fellows? Andy was not analytic by\r\nnature, and he would have stumbled vaguely among words to explain his\r\nviews, but he felt very strongly the injustice of the girl\'s\r\ncondemnation, and he would scarcely speak to Jack Bates and Irish\r\nwhen they came around making overtures for peace and goodwill.', '"If she hadn\'t gone home so sudden, I could uh squared it all right,"\r\nhe told the Little Doctor, whenever her sympathetic attitude won him\r\nto speech upon the subject.', '"Yes, I believe you could," she would agree cheeringly. "If she\'s the\r\nright sort, and cared, you could."', '"She\'s the right sort—I know that," Andy would assert with much\r\ndecision, though modesty forbade his telling the Little Doctor that he\r\nwas also sure she cared. She did care, if a girl\'s actions count for\r\nanything, or her looks and smiles. Of course she cared! Else why did\r\nshe rush off home like that, a good month before she had intended to\r\ngo? They had planned that Andy would get a "lay-off" and go with her\r\nas far as Butte, because she would have to wait there several hours,\r\nand Andy wanted to take her out to the Columbia Gardens and see if she\r\ndidn\'t think they were almost as nice as anything California could\r\nshow. Then she had gone off without any warning because Jack Bates and\r\nIrish had told her a lot of stuff about him, Andy; if that didn\'t\r\nprove she cared, argued Andy to himself, what the dickens would you\r\nwant for proof?', 'It was from thinking these things over and over while he lay in bed,\r\nthat Andy formed the habit of looking often towards the west when his\r\nhurt permitted him to hobble around the house. And when a man looks\r\noften enough in any direction, his feet will, unless hindered by fate\r\nitself, surely follow his gaze if you give them time enough.', "It was the excursion rates advertised in a Great Falls paper that\r\nfirst put the idea consciously into the brain of Andy. They seemed\r\nvery cheap, and the time-limit was generous, and—San Jose was not\r\nvery far from San Francisco, the place named in the advertisement; and\r\nif he could only see the girl and explain—It would be another month\r\nbefore he would be able to work, anyway, and—A man might as well get\r\nrid of a hundred or so travelling, as to sit in a poker game and watch\r\nit fade away, and he would really get more out of it. Anyhow, nobody\r\nneed know where he had gone. They could think he was just going to\r\nButte. And he didn't give a darn if they did find it out!", 'He limped back into the house and began inspecting, with much\r\ndissatisfaction, his wardrobe. He would have to stake himself to new\r\nclothes—but he needed clothes, anyway, that fall. He could get what\r\nhe wanted in Butte, while he waited for the train to Ogden. Now that\r\nAndy had made up his mind to go, he was in a great hurry and grudged\r\nthe days, even the hours, that must pass before he could see Mary\r\nEdith Johnson.', 'Not even the Little Doctor knew the truth, when Andy appeared next\r\nmorning dressed for his journey, ate a hasty and unsatisfactory\r\nbreakfast and took the Old Man to one side with elaborate carelessness\r\nand asked for a sum that made the Old Man blink. But no man might have\r\ncharge of the Happy Family for long without attaining that state of\r\nmental insulation which renders a shock scientifically impossible. The\r\nOld Man wrote a check, twisted his mouth into a whimsical knot and\r\ninquired mildly: "What\'s the brand of devilment this time, and how\r\nlong\'s it going to take yuh?" With a perceptible emphasis on the word\r\nthis.', 'For probably the first time in his life Andy blushed and stammered\r\nover a lie, and before he had got out more than two words, the Old Man\r\nseemed to understand the situation quite thoroughly. He said "Oh, I\r\nsee. Well, git a round-trip ticket and be dead sure yuh don\'t out-stay\r\nthe limit." He took out his pipe and filled it meditatively.', 'Andy blushed again—six weeks indoors had lightened the tan on his\r\nface so that his blushes showed very plainly—and made desperate\r\ndenial. "I\'m only going up to Butte. But a fellow can\'t have any kind\r\nof a time there without a fair-sized roll, and—I\'ll be back in two or\r\nthree weeks—soon as my leg\'s mended thorough. I—"', '"Get along with yuh!" growled the Old Man, though his eyes twinkled.\r\n"Doggone it, don\'t yuh lie to me. Think I was shipped in on the last\r\ntrain? A man don\'t git red in the face when he\'s just merely headed\r\nfor Butte. Why, doggone yuh—"', "The last words had to serve for a farewell, because Andy was limping\r\naway as fast as he could, and did not come back to the house again. He\r\ndid not even tell the Little Doctor good-by, though it was fifteen\r\nminutes before John Wedum, the ranchhand, had the team ready to drive\r\nAndy to town, and he was one of the Little Doctor's most loyal\r\nsubjects.", 'Andy walked haltingly down a palm-shaded street in San Jose and\r\nwondered just what would be the best and quickest way in which to find\r\nMary Edith Johnson. Three ways were open to him: He could hunt up all\r\nthe Johnsons in town—there were three full pages of them in the\r\ndirectory, as he remembered with a sigh—and find out which one was\r\nthe right one; but San Jose, as he had already discovered, was not a\r\nvillage, and he doubted if he could stand the walking. He could visit\r\nall the real estate offices in town—and he was just beginning to\r\nrealize that there were almost as many real estate offices as there\r\nwere Johnsons. And he could promenade the streets in the hope of\r\nmeeting her. But always there was the important fact to face—the fact\r\nthat San Jose is not a village.', 'He came upon a particularly shady spot and a bench placed invitingly.\r\nAndy sat down, eased the new-healed leg out before him and rolled a\r\ncigarette. "This is going to be some different from hunting a stray on\r\nthe range," he told himself, with an air of deliberate cheerfulness.\r\n"If I could get out and scurrup around on a hoss, and round her up\r\nthat way—but this footing it all over town is what grinds me." He\r\ndrew a match along the under side of the bench and held the blaze\r\nabsently to the cigarette. "There was one thing—she told about an\r\norange tree right beside her mother\'s front gate, Maybe—" He looked\r\naround him hopefully. Just across the street was a front gate, and\r\nbeside it an orange tree; he knew because there were ripe oranges\r\nhanging upon it. He started to rise, his blood jumping queerly, sat\r\ndown again and swore. "Every darned gate in town, just about, has got\r\nan orange tree stuck somewhere handy by. I remember \'em now, damn\r\n\'em!"', 'Three cigarettes he smoked while he sat there. When he started on\r\nagain his face was grimly set toward the nearest business street. At\r\nthe first real-estate sign he stopped, pulled together his courage,\r\nand went in. A girl sat in a corner of the room before a typewriter.\r\nAndy saw at a glance that her hair was too dark; murmured something\r\nand backed out. At the next place, a man was crumpled into a big\r\nchair, reading a paper. Behind a high desk a typewriter clicked, but\r\nAndy could not see the operator without going behind the railing, and\r\nhe hesitated.', '"Looking for a snap?" asked the man briskly, coming up from his\r\ncrumpled state like a spring.', '"Well, I was looking—"', '"Now, here. It may not be what you want, but I\'m just going to show\r\nyou this proposition and see what you think of it. It ain\'t going to\r\nlast—somebody\'s goin\' to snap it up before you know it. Now, here—"', 'It was half an hour before Andy got away from that office, and he had\r\nnot seen who was running the machine behind the desk, even then. He\r\nhad, however, spoken rather loudly and had informed the man that he\r\nwas from Montana, with no effect whatever upon the clicking. He had\r\nlistened patiently to the glowing description of several "good buys,"\r\nand had escaped with difficulty within ten minutes after hearing the\r\nunseen typist addressed as "Fern."', 'At the third place he merely looked in at the door and retreated\r\nhastily when the agent, like a spider on the watch, started forward.', "When he limped into the office of his hotel at six o'clock, Andy was\r\nready to swear that every foot of land in California was for sale, and\r\nthat every man in San Jose was trying his best to sell it and looked\r\nupon him, Andy Green, as a weak-minded millionaire who might be\r\ninduced to purchase. He had not visited all the places where they\r\nkept bulletin-boards covered with yellowed placards abounding in large\r\ntype and many fat exclamation points and the word ONLY with a dollar\r\nmark immediately after. All? He had not visited half of them, or a\r\nthird!", 'That night he dreamed feverishly of "five-room, modern cottages with\r\nbath," and of ONLY $500.00 down and balance payable monthly," and of\r\nten-acre "ranches" and five-acre "ranches"—he who had been used to\r\nnumbering acres by the thousand and to whom the word "ranch" meant\r\nmiles of wire fencing and beyond that miles of open!', 'It took all the longing he felt for Mary Johnson to drive him out the\r\nnext morning and to turn his face toward those placarded places which\r\ninfested every street, but he went. He went with eyes that glared\r\nhostility at every man who said "buy," and with chin set to stubborn\r\npurpose. He meant to find Mary Edith Johnson, and he meant to find her\r\nwithout all California knowing that he was looking for her. Not once\r\nhad he mentioned her name, or showed that he cared whether there was a\r\ntypewriter in the office or whether it was a girl, man or Chinaman who\r\nclicked the keys; and yet he knew exactly how every girl typist had\r\nher hair dressed, and what was the color of her eyes.', 'At two o\'clock, Andy stopped suddenly and stared down at a crack in\r\nthe pavement, and his lips moved in muttered speech. "She\'s worked\r\nthree years in one of them places—and she \'thoroughly detests\r\nfalsehood in any form\'! Hell!" Is exactly what he was saying out\r\nloud, on one of the busiest streets in San Jose.', 'A policeman glanced at him, looked again and came slowly toward him.\r\nAndy took the hint and moved on decorously to the next bulletin-board,\r\nbut the revelation that had come to him there in the street dulled\r\nsomewhat his alertness, so that he came near committing himself to the\r\npurchase of one of those ubiquitous "five-room, modern cottages with\r\nbath" before he realized what he was doing and fled to the street\r\nagain, on the pretense that he had to catch the car which was just\r\nslowing down for that crossing.', 'He boarded the car, though he had no idea of where it was going, and\r\nfished in his pocket for a nickel. And just when he was reaching up\r\nfrom the step where he stood clinging—reaching over the flower-piled\r\nhat of a girl, to place the nickel in the outstretched palm of the\r\nconductor, he heard for the first time in many weeks the name of Mary\r\nJohnson. A girl at his elbow was asking the other: "What\'n the world\'s\r\nbecome of Mary Johnson? She wasn\'t to the dance last night, and it\'s\r\nthe first one—"', 'Andy held his breath.', '"Oh, Mame quit her place with Kelly and Gray, two weeks ago. She\'s\r\ngone to Santa Cruz and got a place for the summer. Her and Lola\r\nParsons went together, and—"', 'Andy took advantage of another crossing, and dropped off. He wanted to\r\nfind out when the next train left for Santa Cruz. It never occurred to\r\nhim that there might be two Mary Johnsons in the world, which was\r\nfortunate, perhaps; he wasted no time in hesitation, and so, within\r\ntwenty minutes, he was hearing the wheels of a fast train go\r\nclickety-click, clickety-click over the switches in the suburbs of\r\nSan Jose, and he was asking the conductor what time the train would\r\nreach Santa Cruz, and was getting snubbed for his anxiety.', 'Santa Cruz, when he did reach it, seemed, on a superficial\r\nexamination, to be almost as large as San Jose, and the real-estate\r\noffices closer together and even more plentifully supplied with\r\nmodern cottages and bath—and the heart of him sank prophetically. For\r\nthe first time since he dropped off the street-car in San Jose, it\r\nseemed to him that Mary Johnson was quite as far off, quite as\r\nunattainable as she had ever been.', 'He walked slowly up Pacific Avenue and watched the hurrying crowds,\r\nand wondered if chance would be kind to him; if he should meet her on\r\nthe street, perhaps. He did not want to canvass all the real-estate\r\noffices in town. "It would take me till snow flies," he murmured\r\ndispiritedly, forgetting that here was a place where snow never flew,\r\nand sought a hotel where they were not "full to the eaves" as two\r\ncomplacent clerks had already told him.', 'At supper, he made friends with a genial-voiced insurance agent—the\r\nkind who does not insist upon insuring your life whether you want it\r\ninsured or not. The agent told Andy to call him Jack and use him good\r\nand plenty—perhaps because something wistful and lonely in the gray\r\neyes of Andy appealed to him—and Andy took him at his word and was\r\ngrateful. He discovered what day of the week it was: Saturday, and\r\nthat on the next day Santa Cruz would be "wide-open" because of an\r\nexcursion from Sacramento. Jack offered to help him lose himself in\r\nthe crowd, and again Andy was grateful. For the first time since\r\nleaving the Flying U he went to bed feeling not utterly alone and\r\nfriendless, and awoke pleasantly expectant. Friend Jack was to pilot\r\nhim down to the Casino at eleven, and he had incidentally made one\r\nprediction which stuck closely to Andy, even in his sleep. Jack had\r\nassured him that the whole town would be at the beach; and if the\r\nwhole town were at the beach, why then, Mary would surely be somewhere\r\nin the crowd. And if she were in the crowd—"If she\'s there, I\'ll sure\r\nget a line on her before night," Andy told himself, with much\r\nassurance. "A fellow that\'s been in the habit of cutting any certain\r\nbrand of critter out of a big herd ought to be able to spot his girl\r\nin a crowd"—and he hummed softly while he dressed.', 'The excursion train was already in town, and the esplanade was,\r\nlooking down from Beach Hill, a slow-moving river of hats, with\r\nsplotches of bright colors and with an outer fringe of men and women.\r\n"That\'s a good-sized trail-herd uh humans," Andy remarked, and the\r\ninsurance agent laughed appreciatively.', '"You wait till you see them milling around on the board walk," he\r\nadvised impressively. "If you happen to be looking for anybody, you\'ll\r\nrealize that there\'s some people scattered around in your vicinity. I\r\nhad a date with a girl, down here one Sunday during the season, and we\r\nhunted each other from ten in the morning till ten at night and never\r\ngot sight of each other."', 'Andy gave him a sidelong, suspicious glance, but friend Jack was\r\nevidently as innocent as he looked, and so Andy limped silently down\r\nthe hill to the Casino and wondered if fate were going to cheat him at\r\nthe last moment.', 'Once in the crowd, it was as Jack had told him it would be. He could\r\nnot regard the moving mass of humanity as individuals, though long\r\nliving where men are few had fixed upon him the habit. Now, although\r\nhe observed far more than did Jack, he felt somewhat at a loss; the\r\nrealization that Mary Johnson might pass him unrecognized troubled him\r\ngreatly. It did not once occur to him that he, with his gray Stetson\r\nhat and his brown face and keen eyes and tall, straight-backed figure,\r\nlooked not at all like the thousands of men all around him, so that\r\nmany eyes turned to give him another glance when he passed. Mary\r\nJohnson must be unobserving in the extreme if she failed to know him,\r\nonce she glimpsed him in the crowd.', "Somewhere near one o'clock he lost Jack completely, and drifted\r\naimlessly alone. Jack had been hailed by a friend, had stopped for a\r\nminute to talk, and several hundred men, women and children had come\r\nbetween him and Andy, pushing and crowding and surging, because a band\r\nhad started playing somewhere. Andy got down the steps and out upon\r\nthe sand, and Jack was thereafter but a memory. He found the loose\r\nsand hard walking with his lame leg, and almost as crowded as the\r\npromenade, and as he stood for a minute looking up at the board walk\r\nabove him, it occurred to him that if he could get somewhere and stay\r\nthere long enough, every human being at the Casino would eventually\r\npass by him. He went up the steps again and worked his way along the\r\nedge of the walk until he found a vacant spot on the railing and sat\r\ngrimly down upon it to wait.", 'Many cigarettes he smoked while he roosted there, watching until the\r\neyes of him ached with the eternal panorama of faces that were\r\nstrange. Many times he started eagerly because he glimpsed a fluffy,\r\nblond pompadour with blue eyes beneath, and fancied for an instant\r\nthat it was Mary.', 'Then, when he was speculating upon the advisability of following the\r\nstream of people that flowed out upon the pleasure pier, Mary passed\r\nby so close that her skirt brushed his toes; passed him by, and he sat\r\nthere like a paralytic and let her go. And in the heart of him was a\r\nqueer, heavy throb that he did not in the least understand.', 'She was dressed in blue linen with heavy, white lace in patches here\r\nand there, and she had a big, white hat tilted back from her face and\r\na long white plume drooping to one shoulder. Another girl was with\r\nher, and a man—a man with dented panama hat and pink cheeks and a\r\nwhite waistcoat and tan shoes; a man whom Andy suddenly hated most\r\nunreasonably.', 'When they were all but lost in the crowd, Andy got down, gripped his\r\ncane vindictively and followed. After all, the man was walking beside\r\nthe other girl, and not beside Mary—and the reflection brought much\r\nsolace. With the nodding, white feather to guide him, he followed them\r\ndown the walk, lost them for a second, saw them turn in at the\r\nwide-open doors of the natatorium, saw them pause there, just inside.\r\nThen a huge woman pushed before him, stood there and narrowed his\r\nrange of vision down to her own generous hat with its huge roses, and\r\nwhen he had edged past her the three were gone.', 'Andy waited, comforted by the knowledge that they had not come out,\r\nuntil the minutes passed his patience and he went in, searched the\r\ngallery unavailingly, came out again and wandered on dispiritedly to\r\nthe pleasure pier. There, leaning over the rail, he saw her again\r\nalmost beneath him in the sand, scantily clad in a bathing suit. The\r\nman, still more scantily clad, was trying to coax her into the water\r\nand she was hanging back and laughing a good deal, with an occasional\r\nsqueal.', "Andy leaned rather heavily upon the railing and watched her\r\ngloweringly, incredulously. Custom has much to do with a man's (or a\r\nwoman's) idea of propriety, and one Andrew Green had for long been\r\nunaccustomed to the sight of nice young women disporting themselves\r\nthus in so public a place. He could not reconcile it with the girl as\r\nhe had known her in her father's cabin, and he was not at all sure\r\nthat he wanted to do so.", 'He was just turning gloomily away when she glanced up, saw him and\r\nwaved her hand. "Hello, Andy," she called gaily. "Come on down and\r\ntake a swim, why don\'t you?"', 'Andy, looking reproachfully into her upturned face, shook his head. "I\r\ncan\'t," he told her. "I\'m lame yet." It was not at all what he had\r\nmeant to say, any more than this was the meeting he had dreamed about.\r\nHe resented both with inner rage.', '"Oh. When did you come?" she asked casually, and was whisked away by\r\nthe man before Andy could tell her. The other girl was there also, and\r\nthe three ran gleefully down to meet a roller larger than the others\r\nhad been; met it, were washed, with much screaming and laughter, back\r\nto shore and stood there dripping. Andy glared down upon them and\r\nlonged for the privilege of drowning the fellow.', '"We\'re going up into the plunge," called Mary. "Come on. I\'ll see you,\r\nwhen I come out." They scampered away, and he, calling himself many\r\nkinds of fool, followed.', 'In the plunge, Andy was still more at a disadvantage, for since he\r\nwas a spectator, a huge sign informed him that he must go up stairs.\r\nHe went up with much difficulty into the gallery, found himself a seat\r\nnext the rail and searched long for Mary among the bathers below. He\r\nwould never have believed that he would fail to know her at sight, but\r\nwith fifty women, more or less, dressed exactly alike and with ugly\r\nrubber caps pulled down to eyebrows and ears, recognition must\r\nnecessarily be slow.', "While he leaned and stared, an avalanche of squeals came precipitately\r\ndown the great slide; struck the water and was transformed to gurgling\r\nscreams, and then heads came bobbing to the surface—three heads, and\r\none of them was Mary's. She swept the water from her eyes, looked up\r\nand saw him, waved her hand and scrambled rather ungracefully over the\r\nrail in her wet, clinging suit. The others followed, the man trotting\r\nat her heels and calling something after her.", "Andy, his brows pulled down over unhappy eyes, glared fixedly up at\r\nthe top of the slide. In a minute they appeared, held gesticulating\r\ncounsel, wavered and came down together, upon their stomachs. The\r\nstrange girl was in the lead, with Mary next holding to the girl's\r\nfeet. Behind her slid the man, gripping tightly the ankles of Mary.\r\nAndy's teeth set savagely together, though he saw that others were\r\ndoing exactly the same; old women, young women, girls, men and boys\r\ncame hurtling down the big slide, singly, in couples, in three and\r\nfours.", 'The spectacle began to fascinate him, so that for a minute or two he\r\ncould forget Mary and the man. There was a roar of voices, the barking\r\nas of seals, screams, laughter and much splashing. Men and women dove\r\nfrom the sides like startled frogs into a pond; they swam, floated and\r\nstood panting along the walls; swung from the trapeze (Andy,\r\nremembering his career with the circus, when he was "André de Gréno,"\r\nChampion Bareback Rider of the Western Hemisphere, wished that his leg\r\nwas well so that he could show them a few things about that trapeze\r\nbusiness) and troubled the waters with much splashing. He could not\r\nkeep Mary always in view, but when he did get sight of her she seemed\r\nto be having a very good time, and not to be worrying in the least\r\nabout him and his sins.', "Twice Andy Green half rose from his seat, meaning to leave the plunge,\r\nthe Casino and the whole merry-making crowd; but each time he settled\r\nback, telling himself that he hated a quitter, and that he guessed\r\nhe'd buy a few more chips and stay in the game.", 'It seemed a long time before Mary finally emerged in the blue linen\r\nand the white hat, but Andy was waiting doggedly at the entrance and\r\ntook his place beside her, forcing the man to walk beside the girl\r\nwhom Mary introduced as Lola Parsons. The man\'s name was Roberts, but\r\nthe girls called him Freddie, and he seemed composed mostly of a\r\nself-satisfied smile and the latest fad in male attire. Andy set\r\nhimself to the task of "cutting Mary out of the main herd" so that he\r\nmight talk with her. Thus it happened that, failing a secluded spot in\r\nthe immediate neighborhood of the Casino, which buzzed like a\r\ndisturbed hive of gigantic bees, Mary presently found herself on a car\r\nthat was clanging its signal of departure, and there was no sign of\r\nFreddie and Lola Parsons.', '"We lost \'em, back there," Andy told her calmly when she inquired.\r\n"And as to where we\'re going, I don\'t know; as far as this\r\nlightning-wagon will take us."', '"This car goes clear out to the Cliffs," Mary said discouragingly.', '"All right. We\'re going out to the cliffs, then," Andy smiled blandly\r\ndown upon the nodding, white feather in her hat.', '"But I promised Lola and Freddie—"', '"Oh, that\'s all right. I\'ll take the blame. Were yuh surprised to see\r\nme here?"', '"Why should I be? Everybody comes to Santa Cruz, sooner or later."', '"I came sooner," said Andy, trying to meet her eye. He wanted to bring\r\nthe conversation to themselves, so that he might explain and justify\r\nhimself, and win forgiveness for his sins.', 'While they walked along the cliffs he tried, and going home he had not\r\ngiven up the attempt. But afterward, when he could sit down quietly\r\nand think, he was forced to admit that he had not succeeded very well.\r\nIt seemed to him that, while Mary still liked him and was quite ready\r\nto be friends, she had forgotten just why she had so suddenly left\r\nMontana. She was sorry he had broken his leg, but in the same breath,\r\nalmost, she told him of such a narrow escape that Freddie had last\r\nweek, when an auto nearly ran him down. Andy regretted keenly that it\r\nhad not.', 'He had mentioned Irish and Jack Bates, meaning to refute the tales\r\nthey had told of him, and she had asked about the black lamb and the\r\nwhite, and then had told him that he must go out to the whistling buoy\r\nand see the real whale they had anchored out there, and related with\r\nmuch detail how Freddie had taken her and Lola out, and how the water\r\nwas so rough she got seasick, and a wave splashed over and ruined\r\nFreddie\'s new summer suit, that spotted dreadfully; it wasn\'t, she\r\nremarked, a durable color. She hoped Andy would stay a month or two,\r\nthough the "season" was about over. She knew he would just love the\r\nplunge and the surf-bathing, and there was going to be a boomers\'\r\nbarbacue up at the Big Trees in two weeks—and it would seem like home\r\nto him, seeing a cow roasted whole! She did love Montana, and she\r\nhoped he brought his chaps and spurs along, for she had told Lola so\r\nmuch about him, and she wanted Lola to see him in his Wild West\r\nclothes.', 'All this should have pleased Andy very much. She had not grown cold,\r\nand her eyes were quite as teasing and her smiles as luring as before.\r\nShe did not even lay personal claim to Freddie, that he should be\r\njealous. When she spoke of Freddie, his name was linked with Lola\r\nParsons, and Andy could not glean that she had ever gone anywhere\r\nalone with him. She had seemed anxious that he should enjoy his\r\nvacation to the limit, and had mentioned three or four places that he\r\nmust surely see, and informed him three times that she was "off" at\r\nfive every evening, and could show him around.', 'They had dined together at a café, and had gone back to the Casino for\r\nthe band concert, and they had not been interrupted by meeting Lola\r\nParsons and Freddie, and she had given him a very cordial good-night\r\nwhen they parted on the steps of her boarding house at eleven.', 'So there was absolutely no reason for the mood Andy was in when he\r\naccepted his key from the hotel clerk and went up to his room. For a\r\nman who has traveled more than a thousand miles in search of the girl\r\nhe had dreamed of o\'nights, and who had found her and had been\r\nproperly welcomed, he was distinctly gloomy. He sat down by the open\r\nwindow and smoked four cigarettes, said "Damn Freddy!" three times and\r\nwith added emphasis each time, though he knew very well that Freddie\r\nhad nothing to do with it, and then went to bed.', 'In the morning he felt better, and went out by himself to the cliffs\r\nwhere they had been before, and sat down on a hummock covered with\r\nshort grass, and watched the great unrest of the ocean, and wondered\r\nwhere the Flying U wagons would be camping, that night. Somehow, the\r\nwide reach of water reminded him of the prairie; the rolling billows\r\nwere like many, many cattle milling restlessly in a vast herd and\r\ntossing white heads and horns upward. Below him, the pounding surf was\r\nto him the bellowing of a thirsty herd corralled.', '"This is sure all right," he approved, rousing a little. "It\'s almost\r\nas good as sitting up on a pinnacle and looking out over the range. If\r\nI had a good hoss, and my riding outfit, and could get out there and\r\ngo to work cutting-out them white-caps and hazing \'em up here on a\r\nrun, it wouldn\'t be so poor. By gracious, this is worth the trip, all\r\nright." It never occurred to Andy that there was anything strange in\r\nthe remark, or that he sat there because it dulled the heavy ache that\r\nhad been his since yesterday—the ache of finding what he had sought,\r\nand finding with it disillusionment.', 'Till hunger drove him away he stayed, and his dreams were of the wide\r\nland he had left. When he again walked down Pacific Avenue the hall\r\nclock struck four, and after he had eaten he looked up at it and saw\r\nthat it lacked but fifteen minutes of five.', '"I\'m supposed to meet her when she quits work," he remembered, "and\r\nLola and Freddie will go to the plunge with us." He stopped and stared\r\nin at the window of a curio store. "Say, that\'s a dandy Navajo\r\nblanket," he murmured. "It would be out-uh-sight for a saddle\r\nblanket." He started on, hesitated and went back. "I\'ve got time\r\nenough to get it," he explained to himself. He went in, bought the\r\nblanket and two Mexican serapes that caught his fancy, tucked the\r\nbundle under his arm and started down the street toward the office\r\nwhere Mary worked. It was just two minutes to five.', 'He got almost to the door—so near that his toe struck against a\r\ncorner of the belabelled bulletin board—when a sudden revulsion swept\r\nhis desires back like a huge wave. He stood a second irresolutely and\r\nthen turned back. "Aw—hell! What\'s the use?" he muttered.', 'The clock was just on the last stroke of five when he went up to the\r\nclerk in his hotel. "Say, when does the next train pull out?—I don\'t\r\ngive a darn in what direction," he wanted to know. When the clerk\r\ntold him seven-thirty, he grinned and became undignifiedly loquacious.', '"I want to show yuh a couple of dandy serapes I just glommed, down\r\nstreet," he said, and rolled the bundle open upon the desk. "Ain\'t\r\nthey a couple uh beauts? I got \'em for two uh my friends; they done me\r\na big favor, a month or two ago, and I wanted to kinda square the\r\ndeal. That\'s why I got \'em just alike. Yes, you bet they\'re peaches;\r\nyuh can\'t get \'em like this in Montana. The boys\'ll sure appreciate\r\n\'em." He retied the bundle, took his room-key from the hand of the\r\nsmiling clerk and started up the stairway, humming a tune under his\r\nbreath as he went.', 'At the first turn he stopped and looked back. "Send the bell-hop up to\r\nwake me at seven," he called down to the clerk. "I\'m going to take a\r\nmuch-needed nap—and it\'ll be all your life\'s worth to let me miss\r\nthat train!"', 'The camp of the Flying U, snuggled just within the wide-flung arms of\r\nan unnamed coulee with a pebbly-bottomed creek running across its\r\nfront, looked picturesque and peaceful—from a distance.\r\nDisenchantment lay in wait for him who strayed close enough to hear\r\nthe wrangling in the cook-tent, however, or who followed Slim to where\r\nhe slumped bulkily down into the shade of a willow fifty yards or so\r\nfrom camp—a willow where Pink, Weary, Andy Green and Irish were lying\r\nsprawled and smoking comfortably.', 'Slim grunted and moved away from a grass-hidden rock that was gouging\r\nhim in the back. "By golly, things is getting pretty raw around this\r\ncamp," he growled, by way of lifting the safety-valve of his anger.\r\n"I\'d like to know when that darned grub-spoiler bought into the\r\noutfit, anyhow. He\'s been trying to run it to suit himself all\r\nspring—and if he keeps on, by golly, he\'ll be firing the wagon-boss\r\nand giving all the orders himself!"', 'It would seem that sympathy should be offered him; as if the pause he\r\nmade plainly hinted that it was expected. Andy Green rolled over and\r\nsent him a friendly glance just to hearten him a bit.', '"We were listening to the noise of battle," he observed, "and we were\r\ngoing over, in a minute, to carry off the dead. You had a kinda\r\nanimated discussion over something, didn\'t yuh?" Andy was on his good\r\nbehavior, as he had been for a month. His treatment of his fellows\r\nlately was little short of angelic. His tone soothed Slim to the point\r\nwhere he could voice his woe.', '"Well, by golly, I guess he knows what I think of him, or pretty near.\r\nI\'ve stood a lot from Patsy, off and on, and I\'ve took just about all\r\nI\'m going to. It\'s got so yuh can\'t get nothing to eat, hardly, when\r\nyuh ride in late, unless yuh fight for it. Why, by golly, I caught him\r\njust as he was going to empty out the coffee-boiler—and he knew\r\nblamed well I hadn\'t eat. He\'d left everything go cold, and he was\r\npacking away the grub like he was late breaking camp and had a forty\r\nmile drive before dinner, by golly! I just did save myself some\r\ncoffee, and that was all—but it was cold as that creek, and—" Habit\r\nimpelled him to stop there long enough to run his tongue along the\r\nedge of a half-rolled cigarette, and accident caused his eyes to catch\r\nthe amused quirk on the lips of Pink and Irish, and the laughing\r\nglance they exchanged. Possibly if he could have looked in all\r\ndirections at the same time he would have been able to detect signs of\r\nmirth on the faces of the others as well; for Slim\'s grievances never\r\nseemed to be taken seriously by his companions—which is the price\r\nwhich one must pay for having a body shaped like Santa Claus and a\r\nface copied after our old friend in the moon.', '"Well, by golly, maybe it\'s funny—but I took notice yuh done some\r\nyowling, both uh yuh, the other day when yuh didn\'t get no pie," he\r\nsnorted, lighting his cigarette with unsteady fingers.', '"We wasn\'t laughing at that," lied Pink pacifically.', '"And then, by golly, the old devil lied to me and said there wasn\'t no\r\npie left," went on Slim complainingly, his memory stirred by the taunt\r\nhe had himself given. "But I wouldn\'t take his word for a thing if I\r\nknew it was so; I went on a still-hunt around that tent on my own\r\nhook, and I found a pie—a whole pie, by golly!—cached away under\r\nan empty flour-sack behind the stove! That," he added, staring,\r\nround-eyed, at the group, "that there was right where me and Patsy\r\nmixed. The lying old devil said he never knew a thing about it being\r\nthere at all."', 'Pink turned his head cautiously so that his eyes met the eyes of Andy\r\nGreen. The two had been at some pains to place that pie in a safe\r\nplace so that they might be sure of something appetizing when they\r\ncame in from standing guard that night, but neither seemed to think it\r\nnecessary to proclaim the fact and clear Patsy.', '"I\'ll bet yuh didn\'t do a thing to the pie when yuh did find it?" Pink\r\nhalf questioned, more anxious than he would have owned.', '"By golly, I eat the whole thing and I cussed Patsy between every\r\nmouthful!" boasted Slim, almost in a good-humor again. "I sure got the\r\nold boy stirred up; I left him swearin\' Dutch cuss-words that sounded\r\nlike he was peevish. But I\'ll betche he won\'t throw out the coffee\r\ntill I\'ve had what I want after this, by golly!"', '"Happy Jack is out yet," Weary observed after a sympathetic silence.\r\n"You oughtn\'t to have put Patsy on the fight till everybody was filled\r\nup, Slim. Happy\'s liable to go to bed with an empty tummy, if yuh\r\ndon\'t ride out and warn him to approach easy. Listen over there!"', 'From where they lay, so still was the air and so incensed was Patsy,\r\nthey could hear plainly the rumbling of his wrath while he talked to\r\nhimself over the dishwashing. When he appeared at the corner of the\r\ntent or plodded out toward the front of the wagon, his heavy tread and\r\nstiff neck proclaimed eloquently the mood he was in. They watched and\r\nlistened and were secretly rather glad they were fed and so need not\r\nface the storm which Slim had raised; for Patsy thoroughly roused was\r\nvery much like an angry bull: till his rage cooled he would charge\r\nwhoever approached him, absolutely blind to consequences.', '"Well, I ain\'t going to put nobody next," Slim asserted. "Happy\'s got\r\nto take chances, same as I did. And while we\'re on the subject, Patsy\r\nwas on the prod before I struck camp, or he wouldn\'t uh acted the way\r\nhe done. Somebody else riled him up, by golly—I never."', '"Well, you sure did put the finishing touches to him," contended\r\nIrish, guiltily aware that he himself was originally responsible; for\r\nPatsy never had liked Irish very well because of certain incidents\r\nconnected with his introduction to Weary\'s double. Patsy never could\r\nquite forget, though he might forgive, and resentment lay always close\r\nto the surface of his mood when Irish was near.', 'Happy Jack, hungry and quite unconscious that he was riding straight\r\ninto the trail of trouble, galloped around a ragged point of\r\nservice-berry bushes, stopped with a lurch at the prostrate corral and\r\nunsaddled hastily. Those in the shade of the willow watched him, their\r\nvery silence proclaiming loudly their interest. They might have warned\r\nhim by a word, but they did not; for Happy Jack was never eager to\r\nheed warnings or to take advice, preferring always to abide by the\r\nrule of opposites. Stiff-legged from long riding, the knees of his\r\nold, leather chaps bulging out in transient simulation of bowed limbs,\r\nhe came clanking down upon the cook-tent with no thought but to ease\r\nhis hunger.', 'Those who watched saw him stoop and thrust his head into the tent,\r\nheard a bellow and saw him back out hastily. They chuckled unfeelingly\r\nand strained ears to miss no word of what would follow.', '"Aw, gwan!" Happy Jack expostulated, not yet angry. "I got here quick\r\nas I could—and I ain\'t heard nothing about no new laws uh getting\r\nhere when the whistle blows. Gimme what there is, anyhow."', 'Some sentences followed which, because of guttural tones and German\r\naccent emphasized by excitement, were not quite coherent to the\r\nlisteners. However, they did not feel at all mystified as to his\r\nmeaning—knowing Patsy as they did.', '"Aw, come off! Somebody must uh slipped yuh a two-gallon jug uh\r\nsomething. I\'ve rode the range about as long as you\'ve cooked on it,\r\nand I never knowed a man to go without his supper yet, just because he\r\ncome in late. I betche yuh dassent stand and say that before Chip, yuh\r\nblamed old Dutch—" Just there, Happy Jack dodged and escaped getting\r\nmore than a third of the basin of water which came splashing out of\r\nthe tent.', 'The group under the willows could no longer lie at ease while they\r\nlistened; they jumped up and moved closer, just as a crowd always does\r\nsurge nearer and nearer to an exciting centre. They did not, however,\r\ninterfere by word or deed.', '"If yuh wasn\'t just about ready t\' die of old age and general\r\ncussedness," stormed Happy Jack, "I\'d just about kill yuh for that."\r\nThis, however, is a revised version and not intended to be exact. "I\r\nwant my supper, and I want it blame quick, too, or there\'ll be a dead\r\nDutchman in camp. No, yuh don\'t! You git out uh that tent and lemme\r\ngit in, or—" Happy Jack had the axe in his hand by then, and he swung\r\nit fearsomely and permitted the gesture to round out his sentence.', 'Perhaps there would have been something more than words between them,\r\nfor even a Happy Jack may be goaded too far when he is hungry; but\r\nChip, who had been washing out some handkerchiefs down by the creek,\r\nheard the row and came up, squeezing a ball of wet muslin on the way.\r\nHe did not say much when he arrived, and he did not do anything more\r\nthreatening than hang the handkerchiefs over the guy-ropes to dry,\r\ntying the corners to keep the wind from whipping them away up the\r\ncoulee, but the result was satisfying—to Happy Jack, at least. He ate\r\nand was filled, and Patsy retired from the fray, sullenly owning\r\ndefeat for that time at least. He went up the creek out of sight from\r\ncamp, and he stayed there until the dusk was so thick that his big,\r\nwhite-aproned form was barely distinguishable in the gloom when he\r\nreturned.', 'At daylight he was his old self, except that he was perhaps a trifle\r\ngruff when he spoke and a good deal inclined to silence, and harmony\r\ncame and abode for a season with the Flying U.', 'Patsy had for years cooked for Jim Whitmore and his "outfit"; so many\r\nyears it was that memory of the number was never exact, and even the\r\nOld Man would have been compelled to preface the number with a few\r\nminutes of meditation and a "Lemme see, now; Patsy\'s been cooking for\r\nme—eighty-six was that hard winter, and he come the spring—no, the\r\nfall before that. I know because he like to froze before we got the\r\nmess-house chinked up good—I\'ll be doggoned if Patsy ain\'t gitting\r\nold!" That was it, perhaps: Patsy was getting old. And old age does\r\nnot often sweeten one\'s temper, if you notice. Those angelic old men\r\nand old ladies have nearly all been immortalized in stories and songs,\r\nand the unsung remainder have nerves and notions and rheumatism and\r\ntongues sharpened by all the disappointments and sorrows of their long\r\nlives.', 'Patsy never had been angelic; he had always been the victim of more\r\nor less ill-timed humor on the part of the Happy Family, and the\r\nvictim of hunger-sharpened tempers as well. He had always grumbled and\r\nrumbled Dutch profanity when they goaded him too hard, and his\r\namiability had ever expressed itself in juicy pies and puddings rather\r\nthan in words. On this roundup, however, he was not often amiable and\r\nhe was nearly always rumbling to himself. More than that, he was\r\nbecoming resentful of extra work and bother and he sometimes permitted\r\nhis resentment to carry him farther than was wise.', 'To quarrel with Patsy was rapidly becoming the fashion, and to gossip\r\nabout him and his faults was already a habit; a habit indulged in too\r\nfreely, perhaps, for the good of the camp. Isolation from the world\r\nbrings small things into greater prominence than is normally their\r\ndue, and large troubles are born of very small irritations.', "For two days there was peace of a sort, and then Big Medicine, having\r\neaten no dinner because of a headache, rode into camp about three\r\no'clock and headed straight for the mess-wagon, quite as if he had a\r\nright that must not be questioned. Custom did indeed warrant him in\r\nlunching without the ceremony of asking leave of the cook, for Patsy\r\neven in his most unpleasant moods had never until lately tried to stop\r\nanyone from eating when he was hungry.", "On this day, however, Big Medicine unthinkingly cut into a fresh-baked\r\npie set out to cool. There were other pies, and in cutting one Big\r\nMedicine was supported by precedent; but Patsy chose to consider it an\r\naffront and snatched the pie from under Big Medicine's very nose.", '"You fellers vot iss always gobbling yet, you iss quit it alreatty!"\r\nrumbled Patsy, bearing the pie into the tent with Big Medicine\'s knife\r\nstill lying buried in the lately released juice. "I vork und vork mine\r\nhead off keeping you fellers filled oop tree times a day alreatty; I\r\nnot vork und vork to feed you effery hour, py cosh. You go mitout till\r\nsupper iss reaty for you yet."', 'Big Medicine, his frog-like eyes standing out from his sun-reddened\r\nface, stared agape. "Well, by cripes!" He hesitated, looking about\r\nhim; but whether his search was for more pie or for moral support he\r\ndid not say. Truth to tell, there was plenty of both. He reached for\r\nanother pie and another knife, and he grinned his wide grin at Irish,\r\nwho had just come up. "Dutchy\'s trying to run a whizzer," he remarked,\r\ncutting a defiant gash clean across the second pie. "What do yuh know\r\nabout that?"', '"He\'s often took that way," said Irish soothingly. "You don\'t want all\r\nthat pie—give me about half of it."', 'Big Medicine, his mouth too full for coherent utterance, waved his\r\nhand and his knife toward the shelf at the back of the mess-wagon\r\nwhere three more pies sat steaming in the shade. "Help yourself," he\r\ninvited juicily when he could speak.', 'Those familiar with camp life in the summer have perhaps observed the\r\nmiraculous manner in which a million or so "yellow-jackets" will come\r\nswarming around when one opens a can of fruit or uncovers the sugar\r\njar. It was like that. Irish helped himself without any hesitation\r\nwhatever, and he had not taken a mouthful before Happy Jack, Weary and\r\nPink were buzzing around for all the world like the "yellow-jackets"\r\nmentioned before. Patsy buzzed also, but no one paid the slightest\r\nattention until the last mouthful of the last pie was placed in\r\nretirement where it would be most appreciated. Then Weary became\r\naware of Patsy and his wrath, and turned to him pacifically.', '"Oh, yuh don\'t want to worry none about the pie," he smiled winningly\r\nat him. "Mamma! How do you expect to keep pies around this camp when\r\nyuh go right on making such good ones? Yuh hadn\'t ought to be such a\r\ncrackajack of a cook, Patsy, if you don\'t want folks to eat themselves\r\nsick."', "If any man among them could have soothed Patsy, Weary would certainly\r\nhave been the man; for next to Chip he was Patsy's favorite. To say\r\nthat he failed is only one way of making plain how great was Patsy's\r\nindignation.", '"Aw, yuh made \'em to be eat, didn\'t yuh?" argued Happy Jack. "What\r\ndifference does it make whether we eat \'em now or two hours from now?"', 'Patsy tried to tell them the difference. He called his hands and his\r\nhead to help his rage-tangled tongue and he managed to make himself\r\nvery well understood. They did not argue the fine point of gastronomic\r\nethics which he raised, though they felt that his position was not\r\nunassailable and his ultimate victory not assured.', 'Instead, they peered into boxes and cans which were covered, gleaned\r\na whole box of seeded raisins and some shredded cocoanut just to tease\r\nhim and retired to wrangle ostentatiously over their treasure trove in\r\nthe shade of the bed-tent, leaving Patsy to his anger and his empty\r\ntins.', 'Other men straggled in, drifted with the tide of their appetites to\r\nthe cook-tent, hovered there briefly and retired vanquished and still\r\nhungry. They invariably came over to the little group which was\r\nmunching raisins and cocoanut and asked accusing questions. What was\r\nthe matter with Patsy? Who had put him on the fight like that? and\r\nother inquiries upon the same subject.', 'Just because they were all lying around camp with nothing to do but\r\neat, Patsy was late with his supper that night. It would seem that he\r\ndallied purposely and revengefully, and though the Happy Family flung\r\nat him taunts and hurry-up orders, it is significant that they shouted\r\nfrom a distance and avoided coming to close quarters.', 'Just how and when they began their foolish little game of imitation\r\nbroncho-fighting does not matter. When work did not press and red\r\nblood bubbled they frequently indulged in "rough-riding" one another\r\nto the tune of much taunting and many a "Bet yuh can\'t pitch me\r\noff!" Before supper was called they were hard at it and they quite\r\nforgot Patsy.', '"I\'ll give any man a dollar that can ride me straight up, by cripes!"\r\nbellowed Big Medicine, going down upon all fours by way of invitation.', '"Easy money, and mine from the start!" retorted Irish and immediately\r\nstraddled Big Medicine\'s back. Horses and riders pantingly gave over\r\ntheir own exertions and got out of the way, for Big Medicine played\r\nbronk as he did everything else: with all his heart and soul and\r\nmuscles, and since he was strong as a bull, riding him promised much\r\nin the way of excitement.', '"Yuh can hold on by my collar, but if yuh choke me down I\'ll murder\r\nyuh in cold blood," he warned Irish before he started. "And don\'t yuh\r\ndig your heels in my ribs neither, or I\'m liable to bust every bone\r\nyuh got to your name. I\'m ticklish, by cripes!"', '"I\'ll ride yuh with my arms folded if yuh say so," Irish offered\r\ngenerously. "Move, you snail!" He struck Big Medicine spectacularly\r\nwith his hat, yelled at the top of his voice and the riding began\r\nimmediately and tumultuously.', 'It is very difficult to describe accurately and effectively the\r\nevolutions of a horse when he "pitches" his worst and hardest. It is\r\nstill more difficult to set down in words the gyrations of a man when\r\nhe is playing that he is a broncho and is trying to dislodge the\r\nfellow upon his back. Big Medicine reared and kicked and bellowed and\r\nsnorted. He came down upon a small "pin-cushion" cactus and was\r\nobliged to call a recess while he extracted three cactus spines from\r\nhis knee with his smallest knife-blade and some profanity.', 'He rolled down his trousers\' leg, closed his knife and tossed it to\r\nPink for fear he might lose it, examined critically a patch of grass\r\nto make sure there were no more cacti hidden there and bawled: "Come\r\non, now, I\'ll sure give yuh a run for your money this time, by\r\ncripes!" and began all over again.', 'How human muscles can bear the strain he put upon his own must be\r\nalways something of a mystery. He described curves in the air which\r\nwould sound incredible; he "swapped ends" with all the ease of a real\r\nfighting broncho and came near sending Irish off more than once.\r\nInsensibly he neared the cook-tent, where Patsy so far forgot himself\r\nas to stand just without the lifted flap and watch the fun with sour\r\ninterest.', '"Ah-h want yuh!" yelled Big Medicine, quite purple but far from\r\nsurrender, and gave a leap.', '"Go get me!" shouted Irish, whipping down the sides of his mount\r\nwith his hat.', 'Big Medicine answered the taunt by a queer, twisted plunge which he\r\nhad saved for the last. It brought Irish spread-eagling over his head,\r\nand it landed him fairly in the middle of Patsy\'s great pan of soft\r\nbread "sponge"—and landed him upon his head into the bargain. Irish\r\nwriggled there a moment and came up absolutely unrecognizable and a\r\ngood deal dazed. Big Medicine rolled helplessly in the grass, laughing\r\nhis big, bellowing laugh.', 'It was straight into that laugh and the great mouth from where it\r\nissued, that Patsy, beside himself with rage at the accident,\r\ndeposited all the soft dough which was not clinging to the head and\r\nface of Irish. He was not content with that. While the Happy Family\r\nroared appreciation of the spectacle, Patsy returned with a kettle of\r\nmeat and tried to land that neatly upon the dough.', '"Py cosh, if dat iss der vay you wants your grub, py cosh, dat iss der\r\nvay you gets it alreatty!" he brought the coffee-boiler and threw\r\nthat also at the two, and followed it with a big basin of stewed corn.', 'Irish, all dough as he was, went for him blindly and grappled with\r\nhim, and it was upon this turbulent scene which Chip looked first when\r\nhe rode up. The Happy Family crowded around him gasping and tried to\r\nexplain.', '"They were doing some rough-riding—"', '"By golly, Patsy no business to set his bread dough on the ground!"', '"He\'s throwed away all the supper there is, and I betche—"', '"Mamma! Yuh sure missed it, Chip. You ought—"', '"By cripes, if that Dutch—"', '"Break away there, Irish!" shouted Chip, dismounting hurriedly. "Has\r\nit got so you must fight an old man like that?"', '"Py cosh, I\'ll fight mit him alreatty! I\'ll fight mit any mans vat\r\nshpoils mine bread. Maybe I\'m old yet but I ain\'t dead yet und I could\r\nfight—" The words came disjointedly, mere punctuation points to his\r\nwild sparring.', 'It was plain that Irish, furious though he was, was trying not to\r\nhurt Patsy very much; but it took four men to separate them for all\r\nthat. When they had dragged Irish perforce down to the creek by which\r\nthey had camped, and had yelled to Big Medicine to come on and feed\r\nthe fish, quiet should have been restored—but it was not.', "Patsy was, in American parlance, running amuck. He was jumbling three\r\nlanguages together into an indistinguishable tumult of sound and he\r\nwas emptying the cook-tent of everything which his stout, German\r\nmuscles could fling from it. Not a thing did he leave that was eatable\r\nand the dishes within his reach he scattered recklessly to all the\r\nwinds of heaven. When one venturesome soul after another approached to\r\ncalm him, he found it expedient to duck and run to cover. Patsy's aim\r\nwas terribly exact.", 'The Happy Family, under cover or at a safe distance from the hurtling\r\npans, cans and stove wood, caressed sundry bumps and waited meekly.\r\nIrish and Big Medicine, once more disclosing the features God had\r\ngiven them, returned by a circuitous route and joined their fellows.', '"Look at \'em over there—he\'s emptying every grain uh rolled oats on\r\nthe ground!" Happy Jack was a "mush-fiend." "Somebody better go over\r\nand stop \'im—"', '"You ain\'t tied down," suggested Cal Emmett rather pointedly, and\r\nHappy Jack said no more.', 'Chip, usually so incisively clear as to his intentions and his duties,\r\nwaited irresolutely and dodged missiles along with the rest of them.\r\nWhen Patsy subsided for the very good reason that there was nothing\r\nelse which he could throw out, Chip took the matter up with him and\r\ntold him quite plainly some of the duties of a cook, a few of his\r\nprivileges and all of his limitations. The result, however, was not\r\nquite what he expected. Patsy would not even listen.', '"Py cosh, I not stand for dose poys no more," he declared, wagging his\r\nhead with its shiny crown and the fringe of grizzled hair around the\r\nback. "I not cook grub for dat Irish und dat Big Medicine und Happy\r\nJack und all dose vat cooms und eats mine pies und shpoils mine pread\r\nund makes deirselves fools all der time. If dose fellers shtay on dis\r\ncamp I quits him alreatty." To make the bluff convincing he untied his\r\napron, threw it spitefully upon the ground and stamped upon it\r\nclumsily, like a maddened elephant.', '"Well, quit then!" Chip was fast losing his own temper, what with the\r\nheat and his hunger and a general distaste for camp troubles. "This\r\njangling has got to stop right here. We\'ve had about enough of it in\r\nthe last month. If you can\'t cook for the outfit peaceably—" He did\r\nnot finish the sentence, or if he did the distance muffled the words,\r\nfor he was leading his horse back to the vicinity of the rope corral\r\nthat he might unsaddle and turn him loose.', 'He heard several voices muttering angrily, but his wrath was ever of\r\nthe stiff-necked variety so that he would not look around to see what\r\nwas the matter. The tumult grew, however, until when he did turn he\r\nsaw Patsy stalking off across the prairie with his hat on and his coat\r\nfolded neatly over his arm, and Irish and Big Medicine fighting\r\nwickedly in the open space between the two tents. He finished\r\nunsaddling and then went stalking over to quell this latest\r\ndevelopment.', '"They\'re trying to find out who was to blame," Weary informed him when\r\nhe was quite close. "Bud hasn\'t got much tact: he called Irish a\r\ndough-head. Irish didn\'t think it was true humor, and he hit Bud on\r\nthe nose. He claims that Bud pitched him into that dishpan uh dough\r\nwith malice aforethought. Better let \'em argue the point to a finish,\r\nnow they\'re started. It\'s black eyes for the peacemaker—you believe\r\nme."', 'While the dusk folded them close and the nighthawks swooped from afar,\r\nthe Happy Family gathered round and watched them fight. Chip and Weary\r\nthoughtfully went into the bed-tent and got the guns which were stowed\r\naway in the beds of the combatants, so that when their anger reached\r\nthe killing point they must let it bubble harmlessly until the fires\r\nwhich fed it went cold. Which was exceeding wise of the two, for Big\r\nMedicine and Irish did get to that very point and raged all over the\r\ncamp because they could not shoot each other.', 'The hottest battle must perforce end sometime, and so the camp of the\r\nFlying U did at last settle into some semblance of calm. Irish rolled\r\nhis bed, saddled a horse and rode off toward town, quite as if he were\r\ngoing for good and all. Big Medicine went down to the creek for the\r\nsecond time that evening to wash away the marks of strife, and when he\r\nreturned he went straight to bed without a word to anyone. Patsy was\r\ngone, no man knew whither, and the cook-tent was as nearly wrecked as\r\nmight be.', '"Makes me think uh that time we had the ringtailed tiger in camp,"\r\nsighed Andy Green, shaking sand out of the teakettle so that it could\r\nbe refilled.', '"By golly, I\'d ruther have a whole band uh tagers than this fighting\r\nbunch," Slim affirmed earnestly. Slim was laboring sootily with the\r\nstove-pipe which Patsy had struck askew with a stick of wood.', 'Outside, Happy Jack was protesting in what he believed to be an\r\nundertone against being installed in Patsy\'s place. "Aw, that\'s always\r\nthe way! Anything comes up, it\'s \'Happy, you git in and rustle some\r\nchuck.\' I ain\'t no cook—or if I be they might pay me cook\'s wages.\r\nI betche there ain\'t another man in camp would stand for it.\r\nSomebody\'s got to take that bacon down to the creek and wash it off,\r\nif yuh want any meat for supper. There ain\'t no time to boil beef. If\r\nI\'d a been boss uh this outfit, I betche no blame cook on earth would\r\nuh made rough-house like Patsy done." But no one paid the slightest\r\nattention to Happy Jack, having plenty to think of and to do before\r\nthey slept.', 'Not even the sun, when it shone again, could warm their hearts to a\r\njoy in living. Happy Jack cooked the breakfast, but his coffee was\r\nweak and his biscuits "soggy," and Patsy had managed to make the\r\nbutter absolutely uneatable with sand; also they were late and Chip\r\nwas surly over the double loss of cook and cowboy. Happy Jack packed\r\nfood and dishes in much the same spirit which Patsy had shown the\r\nnight before, climbed sullenly to the high seat, gathered up the reins\r\nof the four restive horses, released the brake and let out a yell\r\nsurcharged with all the bitterness bottled within his soul. He had\r\nnot done anything to precipitate the trouble. Beyond eating half a pie\r\nhe had been an innocent spectator, not even taking part in the\r\nrough-riding. Yet here he was, condemned to the mess-wagon quite as if\r\nhe were to blame for Patsy\'s leaving. The eyes of Happy Jack gazed\r\ngloomily upon the world, and his driving seemed a reckless invitation\r\nto disaster. "I betche I\'ll make \'em good and sick uh my cooking!"\r\nhe plotted while he went rattling and bumping over the untrailed\r\nprairie.', 'He succeeded so well that two days later Chip gave a curt order or two\r\nand headed his wagons, horses and his lean-stomached bunch of riders\r\nfor Dry Lake, passing by even the Flying U coulee in his haste. Just\r\noutside the town, upon the creek which saves the inhabitants from\r\ndying of thirst or delirium tremens, he left the wagons with Happy\r\nJack, Slim and one alien to set up camp and rode dust-dogged to the\r\nlittle, red depot.', 'The telegram which went speeding to Great Falls and to a friend there\r\nwas brief, but it was eloquent and not quite flattering to Happy Jack.\r\nIt read like this:', '"JOHN G. SCOTT,', '  "The Palace, Great Falls.', '  "For God\'s sake send me a cook by return train; must deliver goods\r\n  or die hard.', '  "BENNETT, Flying U."', 'Whether the cook must die hard, or whether he meant the friend, Chip\r\ndid not trouble to make plain. Telegrams are bound by such rigid\r\nlimitations, and he had gone over the ten-word rate as it was. But he\r\ntold Weary to receive the cook, be he white or black, have him restock\r\nthe mess-wagon to his liking and then bring the outfit to the ranch,\r\nwhen Chip would again take it in hand. He said that he was going home\r\nto get a square meal, and he mentioned Happy Jack along with several\r\nprofane words. "Johnny Scott will send a cook, and a good one,"; he\r\nadded hopefully. "Johnny never threw down a friend in his life and he\r\nnever will. And say, Weary, if he wires, you collect the message and\r\nact accordingly. I\'m going to have a decent supper, to-night!" He was\r\nriding a good horse and there was no reason why he should be late in\r\narriving, especially if he kept the gait at which he left town.', "In two hours Weary, Pink and Andy Green were touching hat-brims over a\r\ntelegram from Johnny Scott—a telegram which was brief as Chip's, and\r\nmore illuminating:", '"CHIP BENNETT,', '"Dry Lake.', '"Kidnaped Park hotel chef best cook in town will be on next train.\r\nJ.G. SCOTT."', '"Sounds good," mused Andy, reading it for the fourth time. "But\r\nthere\'s thirteen words in that telegram, if yuh notice."', '"I wish yuh wouldn\'t try to butt in on Happy Jack\'s specialty," Weary\r\nremonstrated, folding the message and slipping it inside the yellow\r\nenvelope. "If this is the same jasper that cooked there a month ago,\r\nwe\'re going to eat ourselves plumb to death; a better meal I never\r\nlaid away inside me than the one I got at the Park Hotel when I was up\r\nthere last time. Come on over to the hotel and eat; their chuck isn\'t\r\nthe best in the world, but it could be a lot worse and still beat\r\nHappy Jack to a jelly."', 'The whole Happy Family—barring Happy Jack, who was sulking in camp\r\nbecause of certain things which had been said of his cooking and which\r\nhe had overheard—clanked spurs impatiently upon the platform and\r\nwaited for the arrival of the train from the West. When at last it\r\nsnorted into town and nosed its way up to the platform they bunched\r\ninstinctively and gazed eagerly at the steps which led down from the\r\nsmoker.', "A slim little man in blue serge, a man with the complexion of a strip\r\nof rawhide and the mustache of a third-rate orchestra leader, felt his\r\nway gingerly down by the light of the brakeman's lantern, hesitated\r\nand then came questioningly toward them, carrying with some difficulty\r\na bulky suitcase.", '"It\'s him, all right," muttered Pink while they waited.', 'The little man stopped apologetically before the group, indistinct in\r\nthe faint light from the office window. Already the train was sliding\r\naway into the dark. "Pardon," he apologized. "I am looking for the U\r\nfich flies."', '"This is it," Weary assured him gravely. "We\'ll take yuh right on out\r\nto camp. Pretty dark, isn\'t it? Let me take your grip—I know the way\r\nbetter than you do." Weary was not in the habit of making himself a\r\nporter for any man\'s accommodation, but the way back to where they had\r\nleft the horses was dark, and the new cook was very small and slight.\r\nThey filed silently back to Rusty Brown\'s place, invited the cook in\r\nfor a drink and were refused with soft-voiced regret and the gracious\r\nassurance that he would wait outside for them.', 'Weary it was, and Pink to bear him company, who piloted the stranger\r\nout to camp and showed him where he might sleep in Patsy\'s bed. Patsy\r\nhad left town, the Happy Family had been informed, with the\r\ndeclaration often repeated that he was "neffer cooming back alreatty."\r\nHe had even left behind him his bed and his clothes rather than meet\r\nagain any member of the Flying U outfit.', '"We\'d like breakfast somewhere near sunrise," Weary told the cook at\r\nparting. "Soon as the store opens in the morning, we\'ll drive in and\r\nyou can stock up the wagon; we\'re pretty near down to', 'cases, judging from the meals we have been getting lately. Hope yuh\r\nmake out all right."', '"I will do very nicely, I thank you," smiled the new cook in the light\r\nof the lantern which stood upon the fireless cook-stove. "I wish you\r\ngood-night, gentlemen, and sweet dreams of loved ones."', '"Say, he\'s a polite son-of-a-gun," Pink commented when they were\r\nriding back to town. "\'The U fich flies\'—that\'s a good one! What is\r\nhe, do you thing? French?"', '"He\'s liable to be most anything, and I\'ll gamble he can build a good\r\ndinner for a hungry man. That\'s the main point," said Weary.', 'At daybreak Weary woke and heard him humming a little tune while he\r\nmoved softly about the cook-tent and the mess-wagon, evidently\r\nsearching mostly for the things which were not there, to judge from\r\nstray remarks which interrupted the love song. "Rolled oat—I do not\r\nfind him," he heard once. And again: "Where the clean towels they are,\r\nthat I do not discover." Weary smiled sleepily and took another nap.', 'The cook\'s manner of announcing breakfast was such that it awoke even\r\nJack Bates, notoriously a sleepy-head, and Cal Emmett who was almost\r\nas bad. Instead of pounding upon a pan and lustily roaring\r\n"Grub-pi-i-ile!" in the time-honored manner of roundup cooks, he\r\ncame softly up to the bed-tent, lifted a flap deprecatingly and\r\nannounced in a velvet voice:', '"Breakfast is served, gentlemen."', 'Andy Green, whose experiences had been varied, sat up and blinked at\r\nthe gently swaying flap where the cook had been standing. "Say, what\r\nwe got in camp?" he asked curiously. "A butler?"', '"By golly, that\'s the way a cook oughta be!" vowed Slim, and reached\r\nfor his hat.', 'They dressed hastily and trooped down to the creek for their morning\r\nablutions, and hurried back to the breakfast which waited. The new\r\ncook was smiling and apologetic and anxious to please. The Happy\r\nFamily felt almost as if there were a woman in camp and became very\r\npolite without in the least realizing that they were not behaving in\r\nthe usual manner, or dreaming that they were unconsciously trying to\r\nlive up to their chef.', '"The breakfast, it is of a lacking in many things fich I shall\r\nendeavor to remedy," he assured them, pouring coffee as if he were\r\nserving royalty. He was dressed immaculately in white cap and apron,\r\nand his mustache was waxed to a degree which made it resemble a cat\'s\r\nwhiskers. The Happy Family tasted the coffee and glanced eloquently at\r\none another. It was better than Patsy\'s coffee, even; and as for Happy\r\nJack—', 'There were biscuits, the like of which they never had tasted before.\r\nThe bacon was crisp and delicately brown and delicious, the potatoes\r\ncooked in a new and enticing way. The Happy Family showed its\r\nappreciation as seemed to them most convincing: They left not a scrap\r\nof anything and they drank two cups of coffee apiece when that was not\r\ntheir habit.', 'Later, they hitched the four horses to the mess-wagon, learned that\r\nthe new cook, though he deeply regretted his inefficiency, did not\r\ndrive anything. "The small burro," he explained, "I ride him, yes, and\r\nalso the automobile drive I when the way is smooth. But the horses I\r\nmake not acquainted with him. I could ride upon the elevated seat,\r\nyes, but to drive the quartet I would not presume."', '"Happy, you\'ll have to drive," said Weary, his tone a command.', '"Aw, gwan!" Happy Jack objected, "He rode out here all right last\r\nnight—unless somebody took him up in front on the saddle, which I\r\nhain\'t heard about nobody doing. A cook\'s supposed to do his own\r\ndriving. I betche—"', 'Weary went close and pointed a finger impressively. "Happy, you\r\ndrive," he said, and Happy Jack turned without a word and climbed\r\nglumly up to the seat of the mess-wagon.', '"Well, are yuh coming or ain\'t yuh?" he inquired of the cook in a tone\r\nsurcharged with disgust.', '"If you will so kindly permit, it give me great pleasure to ride with\r\nyou and to make better friendship. It now occurs to me that I have not\r\nyet introduce. Gentlemen, Jacques I have the honor to be name. I am\r\ndelighted to meet you and I hope for pleasant association." The bow he\r\ngave the group was of the old school.', 'Big Medicine grinned suddenly and came forward. "Honest to grandma,\r\nI\'m happy to know yuh!" he bellowed, and caught the cook\'s hand in a\r\ngrip that sent him squirming upon his toes. "These here are my\r\nfriends: Happy Jack up there on the wagon, and Slim and Weary and Pink\r\nand Cal and Jack Bates and Andy Green—and there\'s more scattered\r\naround here, that don\'t reely count except when it comes to eating.\r\nWe like you, by cripes, and we like your cookin\' fine! Now, you amble\r\nalong to town and load up with the best there is—huh?" It occurred to\r\nhim that his final remarks might be construed as giving orders, and he\r\nglanced at Weary and winked to show that he meant nothing serious. "So\r\nlong, Jakie,"he added over his shoulder and went to where his horse\r\nwaited.', 'Jacques—ever afterward he was known as "Jakie" to the Flying\r\nU—clambered up the front wheel and perched ingratiatingly beside\r\nHappy Jack, and they started off behind the riders for the short mile\r\nto Dry Lake. Immediately he proceeded to win Happy from his glum\r\naloofness.', '"I would say, Mr. Happy, that I should like exceeding well to be\r\nfriends together," he began purringly. "So superior a gentleman must\r\nwin the admiration of the onlooker and so I could presume to question\r\nfor advisement. I am experience much dexterity for cooking, yes, but I\r\nam yet so ignorant concerning the duties pertaining to camp. If the\r\ndriving of these several horses transpire to pertain, I will so gladly\r\nreceive the necessary instruction and endeavor to fulfil the\r\naccomplishment. Yes?"', 'Happy Jack, more in stupefaction at the cook\'s vocabulary than\r\nanything else, turned his head and took a good look at him. And the\r\ntrustful smile of Jakie went straight to the big, soft heart of him\r\nand won him completely. "Aw, gwan," he adjured gruffly to hide his\r\nsurrender. "I don\'t mind driving for yuh. It ain\'t that I was kicking\r\nabout."', '"I thank you for the so gracious assurement. If I transgress not too\r\ngreatly, I should like for inquire what is the chuck for which I am\r\ntold to fill the wagon. I do not," he added humbly, "understand yet\r\nall the language of your so glorious country, for fich I have so\r\ndiligently study the books. Words I have not yet assimilated\r\ncompletely, and the word chuck have yet escape my knowledge."', '"Chuck," grinned Happy Jack, "is grub."', '"Chuck, it is grub," repeated Jakie thoughtfully. "And grub, that\r\nis—Yes?"', 'Happy Jack struggled mentally with the problem. "Well, grub is grub;\r\nall the stuff yuh eat is grub. Meat and flour and coffee and—"', '"Ah, the light it dawns!" exclaimed Jakie joyously. "Grub it is the\r\nsupply of provision fich I must obtain for camping, yes? I thank you\r\nso graciously for the information; because," he added a bit wistfully,\r\n"that little word chuck she annoy me exceeding and make me for not\r\nsleep that I must grasp the meaning fich elude. I am now happy that I\r\ndo not make the extensive blunder for one small word fich I apprehend\r\nmust be a food fich I must buy and perhaps not to understand the\r\npreparation of it. Yes? It is the excellent jest at the expense of\r\nme."', '"There ain\'t much chuck in camp," Happy observed helpfully, "so yuh\r\nmight as well start in and get anything yuh want to cook. The outfit\r\nis good about one thing They don\'t never kick on the stuff yuh eat.\r\nThe cook always loads up to suit himself, and nobody don\'t ask\r\nquestions or make a holler—so long as there\'s plenty and it\'s good."', 'Jakie listened attentively, twisting his mustache ends absently. "It\r\nis simply that I purchase the supplies fich I shall choose for my\r\njudgment," he observed, to make quite sure that he understood. "I am\r\nto have carte blanche, yes?"', '"Sure, if yuh want it," said Happy Jack. "Only they might not keep it\r\nhere. Yuh can\'t get everything in a little place like this." It is\r\nonly fair to Happy Jack to state that he would have understood the\r\nterm if he had seen it in print. It was the pronunciation which made\r\nthe words strange to him.', 'Jakie looked puzzled, but being the soul of politeness he made no\r\ncomment—perhaps because Happy Jack was at that moment bringing his\r\nfour horses to a reluctant stand at the wide side-door of the store.', '"The horses, they are of the vivacious temperament, yes?" Jakie had\r\nscrambled from the seat to within the door and was standing there\r\nsmiling appreciatively at the team.', '"Aw, they\'re all right. You go on in—I guess Weary\'s there. If he\r\nain\'t, you go ahead and get what yuh want. I\'ll be back after awhile."\r\nThirst was calling Happy Jack; he heeded the summons and disappeared,\r\nleaving the new cook to his own devices.', 'So, it would seem, did every other member of the Flying U. Weary had\r\nbeen told that Miss Satterly was in town, and he forgot all about\r\nJakie in his haste to find her. No one else seemed to feel any\r\nresponsibility in the matter, and the store clerks did not care what\r\nthe Flying U outfit had to eat. For that reason the chuck-wagon\r\ncontained in an hour many articles which were strange to it, and\r\nlacked a few things which might justly be called necessities.', '"Say, you fellows are sure going to live swell," one of the clerks\r\nremarked, when Happy Jack finally returned. "Where did yuh pick his\r\nnibs? Ain\'t he a little bit new and shiny?"', '"Aw, he\'s all right," Happy Jack defended jealously. "He\'s a real\r\nchaff, and he can build the swellest meals yuh ever eat. Patsy can\'t\r\ncook within a mile uh him. And clean—I betche he don\'t keep his\r\nbread-dough setting around on the ground for folks to tromp on." Which\r\nproves how completely Jakie had subjugated Happy Jack.', 'That night—nobody but the horse-wrangler and Happy Jack had shown up\r\nat dinner-time—the boys of the Flying U dined luxuriously at their\r\nnew-made camp upon the creek-bank at the home ranch, and ate things\r\nwhich they could not name but which pleased wonderfully their palates.\r\nThere was a salad to tempt an epicure, and there was a pudding the\r\nlike of which they had never tasted. It had a French name which left\r\nthem no wiser than before asking for it, and it looked, as Pink\r\nremarked, like a snowbank with the sun shining on it, and it tasted\r\nlike going to heaven.', '"It makes me plumb sore when I think of all the years I\'ve stood for\r\nPatsy\'s slops," sighed Cal Emmett, rolling over upon his back because\r\nhe was too full for any other position—putting it plainly.', '"By golly, I never knowed there was such cookin\' in the world," echoed\r\nSlim. "Why, even Mis\' Bixby can\'t cook that good."', '"The Countess had ought to come down and take a few lessons," declared\r\nJack Bates emphatically. "I\'m going to take up some uh that pudding\r\nand ask her what she thinks of it."', '"Yuh can\'t," mourned Happy Jack. "There ain\'t any left—and I never\r\ngot more\'n a taste. Next time, I\'m going to tell Jakie to make it in a\r\nwash tub, and make it full; with some uh you gobblers in camp—"', 'He looked up and discovered the Little Doctor approaching with Chip.\r\nShe was smiling a friendly welcome, and she was curious about the new\r\ncook. By the time she had greeted them all and had asked all the\r\nquestions she could think of and had gone over to meet Jakie and to\r\ntaste, at the urgent behest of the Happy Family, a tiny morsel of\r\nsalad which had been overlooked, it would seem that the triumph of the\r\nnew cook was complete and that no one could possibly give a thought to\r\nold Patsy.', 'The Little Doctor, however, seemed to regret his loss—and that in the\r\nface of the delectable salad and the smile of Jakie. "I do think it\'s\r\na shame that Patsy left the way he did," she remarked to the Happy\r\nFamily in general, being especially careful not to look toward Big\r\nMedicine. "The poor old fellow walked every step of the way to the\r\nranch, and Claude"—that was Chip\'s real name—"says it was\r\ntwenty-five or six miles. He was so lame and he looked so old and\r\nso—well, friendless, that I could have cried when he came limping\r\nup to the house! He had walked all night, and he got here just at\r\nbreakfast time and was too tired to eat.', '"I dosed him and doctored his poor feet and made him go to bed, and he\r\nslept all that day. He wanted to start that night for Dry Lake, but of\r\ncourse we wouldn\'t let him do that. He was wild to leave, however, so\r\nJ.G. had to drive him in the next day. He went off without a word to\r\nany of us, and he looked so utterly dejected and so—so old. Claude\r\nsays he acted perfectly awful in camp, but I\'m sure he was sorry for\r\nit afterwards. J.G. hasn\'t got over it yet; I believe he has taken it\r\nto heart as much as Patsy seemed to do. He\'s had Patsy with him for so\r\nlong, you see—he was like one of the family." She stopped and\r\nregarded the Happy Family a bit anxiously. "This new cook is a very\r\nnice little man," she added after a minute, "but after all, he isn\'t\r\nPatsy."', 'The Happy Family did not answer, and they refrained from looking at\r\none another or at the Little Doctor.', 'At last Big Medicine brought his big voice into the awkward silence.\r\n"Honest to grandma, Mrs. Chip," he said earnestly, "I\'d give a lot\r\nright now to have old Patsy back—er—just to have around, if it\r\nmade him feel bad to leave. I reckon maybe that was my fault: I hadn\'t\r\noughta pitched quite so hard, and I had oughta looked where I was\r\nthrowin\' m\' rider. I reelize that no cook likes to have a fellow\r\nstandin\' on his head in a big pan uh bread-sponge, on general\r\nprinciples if not on account uh the bread. Uh course, we\'ve all knowed\r\nold Patsy to take just about as great liberties himself with his\r\nsponge—but we\'ve got to recollect that it was his dough, by cripes,\r\nand that pipe ashes ain\'t the same as a fellow takin\' a shampoo in\r\nthe pan. No, I reelize that I done wrong, and I\'m willin\' to apologize\r\nfor it right here and now. At the same time," he ended dryly, "I will\r\nown that I\'m dead stuck on little Jakie, and I\'d ruther ride for the\r\nFlying U and eat Jakie\'s grub than any other fate I can think of right\r\nnow. Whilst I\'m sorry for what I done, yuh couldn\'t pry me loose from\r\nJakie with a stick uh dynamite—and that\'s a fact, Mrs. Chip."', 'The Little Doctor laughed, pushed back her hair in the way she had,\r\nglanced again at the unresponsive faces of the original members of the\r\nHappy Family and gave up as gracefully as possible.', '"Oh, of course Patsy\'s an old crank, and Jakie\'s a waxed angel," she\r\nsurrendered with a little grimace. "You think so now, but that\'s\r\nbecause you are being led astray by your appetites, like all men. You\r\njust wait: You\'ll be homesick for a sight of that fat, bald-headed,\r\ncranky old Patsy bouncing along on the mess-wagon and swearing in\r\nDutch at his horses, before you\'re through. If you\'re not so\r\ncompletely gone over to Jakie that you will eat nothing but what he\r\nhas cooked, come on up to the house. The Countess is making a\r\ntwogallon freezer of ice-cream for you, and she has a big pan of\r\nangel cake to go with it! You don\'t deserve it—but come along\r\nanyway." Which was another endearing way of the Little Doctor\'s—the\r\nway of sweetening all her lectures with something very nice at the\r\nend.', "The Happy Family felt very much ashamed and very sorry that they could\r\nnot feel kindly toward Patsy, even to please the Little Doctor. They\r\nsincerely wanted to please her and to have her unqualified approval;\r\nbut wanting Patsy back, or feeling even the slightest regret that he\r\nwas gone, seemed to them a great deal too much to ask of them. Since\r\nthis is a story of cooks and of eating, one may with propriety add,\r\nhowever, that the invitation to ice cream and angel cake, coming\r\nthough it did immediately after that wonderful supper of Jakie's, was\r\naccepted with alacrity and their usual thoroughness of accomplishment;\r\nnot for the world would they have offended the Little Doctor by\r\ndeclining so gracious an invitation—the graciousness being manifested\r\nin her smile and her voice rather than in the words she spoke—leaving\r\nout the enchantment which hovers over the very name of angel cake and\r\nice cream. The Happy Family went to bed that night as complacently\r\nuncomfortable as children after a Christmas dinner.", 'Not often does it fall to the lot of a cowboy to have served to him\r\nstuffed olives and lobster salad with mayonnaise dressing, French\r\nfried potatoes and cream puffs from the mess-tent of a roundup outfit.\r\nDuring the next week it fell to the lot of the Happy Family, however.\r\nWhen the salads and the cream puffs disappeared suddenly and the smile\r\nof Jakie became pensive and contrite, the Happy Family, acting\r\nindividually but unanimously, made inquiries.', '"It is that I no more possess the fresh vegetables, nor the eggs,\r\ngentlemen," purred Jakie. "Many things of a deliciousness must I now\r\nabstain because of the absence of two, three small eggs! But see, one\r\nbrief arrival in the small town would quickly remedy, yes? It is that\r\nwe return with haste that I may buy more of the several articles for\r\nfich I require?" He spread his small hands appealingly.', '"By golly, Patsy never had no eggs—" began Slim traitorously.', '"Aw, gwan! Patsy never fed yuh like Jakie does, neither!" Happy Jack\r\nwas heart and soul the slave of the chef. "If Chip don\'t care, I\'ll\r\nride over to Nelson\'s and git some eggs. Jakie said he\'d make some\r\nmore uh that pudding if he had some. It ain\'t but six or seven miles."', '"Should you but obtain the juvenile hen, yes, I should be delighted to\r\nserve the chicken salad for luncheon. It is the great misfortune that\r\nthe fresh vegetable are not obtain, but I will do the best and\r\nsubstitute with a cleverness fich will conceal the defect—yes?"\r\nJakie\'s caps and aprons had lost their first immaculate freshness, but\r\nhis manner was as royally perfect as ever and his smile as wistfully\r\nfriendly.', '"Well, I\'ll ask Chip about it," Happy Jack yielded.', 'Eggs and young chickens were of a truth strange to a roundup in full\r\nblast, but so was a chef like Jakie, and so were the salads, stuffed\r\nolives and cream puffs; and the white caps and the waxed mustache and\r\nthe beautiful flow of words and the smile. The Happy Family was in no\r\ncondition, mentally or digestively, to judge impartially. A month ago\r\nthey would have whooped derision at the suggestion of riding anywhere\r\nafter fresh eggs and "juvenile hens," but now it seemed to them very\r\nnatural and very necessary. So much for the demoralization of expert\r\ncookery and white caps and a smile.', 'Chip also seemed to have fallen under the spell. It may have been that\r\nthe heavenly peace which wrapped the Flying U was, in his mind, too\r\nprecious to be lightly disturbed. At any rate he told Happy Jack\r\nbriefly to "Go ahead, if you want to," and so left unobstructed the\r\npath to the chicken salad and cream puffs. Happy Jack wiped his hands\r\nupon an empty flour sack, rolled down his shirtsleeves and hurried off\r\nto saddle a horse.', 'Happy Jack did not realize that he was doing two thirds of the work\r\nabout the cook-tent, but that was a fact. Because Jakie could not\r\ndrive the mess-wagon team, Happy Jack had been appointed his\r\nassistant. As assistant he drove the wagon from one camping place to\r\nanother, "rustled" the wood, peeled the potatoes, tended fires and\r\nwashed dishes, and did the thousand things which do not require expert\r\nhands, and which, in time of stress, usually falls to the\r\nhorse-wrangler. Jakie was ever smiling and always promising, in his\r\npurring voice, to cook something new and delicious, and left with the\r\nleisure which Happy\'s industry gave him, he usually kept his promise.', '"Now, Mr. Happy," he would smile, "I am agreeable to place the\r\nconfidence in your so gracious person that you prepare the potatoes,\r\nyes? And that you attend to the boiling of meat and the unpacking and\r\narrangement of those necessary furnishings for fich you possess the\r\ngreat understanding. And I shall prepare the so delicious dessert of\r\nthe floating island, what you call in America. Yes? Our friends will\r\nhave the so delightful astonishment when they arrive. They shall\r\nexclaim and partake joyously, is it not? And for your reward, Mr.\r\nHappy, I shall be so pleased to set aside a very extensive portion of\r\nthe delicious floating island, so that you can eat no more except you\r\nendanger your handsome person from the bursting. Yes?" And oh, the\r\nsmile of him!', 'A man of sterner stuff than Happy Jack would have fallen before such\r\nguile and would have labored willingly—nay, gladly in the service of\r\nso delightful a diplomat as Jakie. Except for that willing service,\r\nJakie would have been quite overwhelmed by the many and peculiar\r\nduties of a roundup cook. He would have been perfectly helpess before\r\nthe morning and noon packing of dishes and food, and the skilful haste\r\nnecessary to unpack and prepare a meal for fifteen ravenous appetites\r\nwithin the time limit would have been utterly impossible. Jakie was a\r\nchef, trained to his profession in well-appointed kitchens and with\r\nassistance always at hand; which is a trade apart from cooking for a\r\nroundup crew.', 'Happy Jack, in the fulness of time, returned with the eggs. That is,\r\nhe returned with six eggs and a quart or two of a yellowish mixture\r\nthickly powdered with shell. He took the pail to Jakie and he saw the\r\nseraphic smile fade from his face and an unpleasant glitter creep into\r\nhis eyes.', '"It is the omelet fich you furnish, yes? The six eggs, they will not\r\nmake the pudding. The omelet—I do not perceive yet the desirableness\r\nof the omelet. And the juvenile hen—yes?"', '"Aw, they wouldn\'t sell no chickens." Happy Jack\'s face had gone long\r\nand scarlet before the patent displeasure of the other. "And my horse\r\nwas scared uh the bucket and pitched with me."', 'Jackie looked again into the pail, felt gingerly the yellow mess and\r\ndiscovered one more egg which retained some semblance of its original\r\nform. "The misfortune distresses me," he murmured. "It is that you\r\nreturn hastily, Mr. Happy, and procure other eggs fich you will place\r\nunbroken in my waiting hands, yes?"', 'Happy Jack mopped his forehead and glanced at the sun, burning hotly\r\ndown upon the prairie. They had made a short move that day and it was\r\nstill early. But the way to Nelson\'s and back had been hot and\r\ntumultuous and he was tired. For the first time since his abject\r\nsurrender to the waxed smile, Happy Jack chafed a bit under the yoke\r\nof voluntary servitude. "Aw, can\'t yuh cook something that don\'t take\r\nso many eggs?" he asked in something like his old, argumentative tone.', 'The unpleasant glitter in the eyes of Jakie grew more pronounced; grew\r\neven snaky, in the opinion of Happy Jack. "It is that I am no more\r\npermitted the privilege of preparing the food for fich I have the\r\njudgment, yes?" His voice purred too much to be convincing. "It is\r\nthat I am no more the chef to be obeyed by my servant?"', '"Aw, gwan! I ain\'t anybody\'s servant that I ever heard of!" Happy Jack\r\nfelt himself bewilderedly slipping from his loyalty. What had come\r\nover Jakie, to act like this? He walked away to where there was some\r\nshade and sat down sullenly. Jakie\'s servant, was he? Well! "The\r\ndarned little greasy-faced runt," he mumbled rebelliously, and\r\nimmediately felt the better for it.', "Two cigarettes brought coolness and calm. Happy Jack wanted very much\r\nto lie there and take a nap, but his conscience stirred uneasily. The\r\nboys were making a long circle that day and would come in with the\r\nappetites—and the tempers—of wolves. It occurred to Happy Jack that\r\ntheir appetites were much keener than they had ever been before, and\r\nhe sat there a little longer while he thought about it; for Happy\r\nJack's mind was slow and tenacious, and he hated to leave a new idea\r\nuntil he had squeezed it dry of all mystery. He watched Jakie moving\r\nin desultory fashion about the tent—but most of the time Jakie stayed\r\ninside.", '"I betche the boys ain\'t gitting enough old stand-by-yuh chuck," he\r\ndecided at length. "Floatin\' island and stuffed olives—for them that\r\nlikes stuffed olives—and salad and all that junk tastes good—but I\r\nbetche the boys need a good feed uh beans!" Which certainly was\r\nbrilliant of Happy Jack, even if it did take him a full hour to arrive\r\nat that conclusion. He got up immediately and started for the\r\ncook-tent.', '"Say, Jakie," he began before he was inside, "ain\'t there time enough\r\nto boil a pot uh beans if I make yuh a good fire? I betche the boys\r\nwould like a good feed—"', '"A-a-hh!" Happy Jack insisted afterward that it sounded like the\r\nsnarling of a wolf over a bone. "Is it that you come here to give the\r\norders? Is it that you insult?" Followed a torrent of molten French,\r\nas it were. Followed also Jakie, with the eyes of a snake and the\r\ntoothy grin of a wild animal and with a knife which Happy Jack had\r\nnever seen before; a knife which caught the sunlight and glittered\r\nhorridly.', 'Happy Jack backed out as if he had inadvertently stirred a nest of\r\nhornets. Jakie almost caught him before he took to his heels. Happy\r\nnever waited to discover what the new cook was saying, or whether he\r\nwas following or remaining at the tent. He headed straight for the\r\nprotection of the horse-wrangler, who watched his cavvy not far away,\r\nand his face was the color of stale putty.', 'The horse-wrangler saw him coming and came loping up to meet him.\r\n"What\'s eating yuh, Happy?" he inquired inelegantly.', '"Jakie—he\'s gone nutty! He come at me with a knife, and he\'d uh\r\nkilled me if I\'d stayed!" Happy Jack pantingly recovered himself. "I\r\ndidn\'t have no time ta git my gun," he added in a more natural tone,\r\n"or I\'d uh settled him pretty blame quick. So I come out to borrow\r\nyourn. I betche I\'ll have the next move."', 'The horse-wrangler grinned heartlessly. "I reckon he\'s about half\r\nshot," he said, sliding over in the saddle and getting out the\r\ninevitable tobacco sack and papers. "Old Pete Williams rode past while\r\nyou were gone, loaded to the guards and with a bottle uh whisky in\r\neach saddle-pocket and two in his coat. He gave me a drink, and then\r\nhe went on and stopped at camp. He was hung up there for quite a\r\nspell, I noticed. I didn\'t see him pass any uh the vile liquor to\r\nlittle Jakie, but—" he twirled a blackened match stub in his fingers\r\nand then tossed it from him.', '"Aw, gwan! Jakie wouldn\'t touch nothing when he was in town," Happy\r\nJack objected. "I betche he\'s gone crazy, or else—"', '"Well," interrupted the horse-wrangler, "I\'ve told yuh what I know and\r\nall I know. Take it or leave it." He rode back to turn the lead-horse\r\nfrom climbing a ridge where he did not want the herd to follow. He did\r\nnot lend Happy Jack his gun, and for that reason—perhaps—Jakie\r\nremained alive and unpunctured until the first of the riders came\r\nloping in to camp.', 'The first riders happened to be Pink and Big Medicine. They were met\r\nby a tearful, contrite Jakie—a Jakie who seemed much inclined to\r\nweeping upon their shirt-fronts and to confessing all his sins,\r\nparticularly the sin of trying to carve Happy Jack. That perturbed\r\ngentleman made his irate appearance as soon as he found that\r\nreinforcements had arrived.', 'Big Medicine disengaged himself from the clinging arms of the chef,\r\nsniffed suspiciously and wiped away the tears from his vest. "Well,\r\nsay," he bellowed in his usual manner of trying to make all Chouteau\r\nCounty hear what he had to say, "I ain\'t t\' blame if he got away on\r\nyuh. Yuh hadn\'t ought to uh done it—or else yuh oughta made a clean\r\njob of it sos\'t we could hang yuh proper. Supper ready?"', '"It is that the supply of eggs is inadequate," wept Jakie, steadying\r\nhimself against the tent-pole while he wiped his eyes upon his apron.\r\n"Because of it I could not prepare the floating island—and without\r\nthe dessert I have not the heart to prepare the dinner, yes? It is\r\nthat I am breaking of the heart that I assail the good friend of me.\r\nOh, Mr. Happy, it is that I crave pardon!"', 'Happy Jack came near taking to his heels again when he saw Jakie start\r\nfor him; he did back up hastily, and his evident reluctance to embrace\r\nand forgive started afresh the tears of remorse. Jakie wailed volubly\r\nand, catching Pink unaware, he wept upon his bosom.', 'Others came riding in, saw the huddle before the mess-tent and came up\r\nto investigate. With every fresh arrival Jakie began anew his\r\nconfession that he had attempted to murder his good friend, Mr. Happy,\r\nand with every confession he wept more copiously than before.', 'The Happy Family tacitly owned itself helpless. A warlike cook they\r\ncould deal with. A lazy cook they could kick into industry. A weeping,\r\nwailing, conscience-stricken cook, a cook who steadfastly refused to\r\nbe comforted, was an absolutely new experience. They told him to buck\r\nup, found that he only broke out anew, threatened, cajoled and argued.\r\nJakie clung to whoever happened to be within reach and mixed the\r\nEnglish language unmercifully.', '"Happy, you\'ll have to forgive him," said Weary at last. "Go tell him\r\nyuh don\'t feel hard towards him. We want some supper."', '"Aw, gwan. I ain\'t forgive him, and I never will. I—"', 'Big Medicine stepped into the breach. With his face contorted into a\r\ngrin to crimple one\'s spine, with a voice to make one\'s knees buckle,\r\nhe went up to Happy Jack and thrust that horrible grin into Happy\'s\r\nvery face. "By cripes, you forgive Jakie, and you do it quick!" he\r\nthundered. "Think you\'re going to ball up the eating uh the whole\r\noutfit whilst you stand around acting haughty? Why, by cripes, I\'ve\r\nkilled men in the Coconino County for half what you\'re doing! You\'ll\r\nwish, by cripes, that Jakie had slit your hide; you\'ll consider that\r\nwoulda been an easy way out, before I git half through with yuh. You\r\nwalk right up and shake hands with him, and you tell him that yuh love\r\nhim to death and are his best friend and always will be! Yuh hear\r\nme?"', 'Happy Jack heard. The Happy Family considerately moved aside and left\r\nhim a clear path, and they looked on without a word while he took\r\nJakie\'s limp hand, muttered tremulously, "Aw, fergit it, Jakie. I\r\nknow yuh didn\'t mean nothing by it, and I forgive yuh," and backed\r\naway again.', 'Jakie wept, this time with gratitude. They got him inside a tent,\r\nunrolled his bed and persuaded him to lie down upon it. They searched\r\nthe mess-box, found all that was left of a quart bottle of whisky,\r\ntook it outside and divided it gravely and appreciatively among\r\nthemselves. There was not much to divide.', 'Happy Jack took charge of the pots and pans, with the whole Happy\r\nFamily to help him hurry supper, while Jakie forgot his woes in sleep\r\nand the sun set upon a quiet camp.', 'Next morning, Jakie was up and cooking breakfast at the appointed\r\ntime, and the camp felt that the incident of the evening before might\r\nwell be forgotten. The coffee was unusually good that morning, even\r\nfor Jakie. He was subdued, was Jakie, and his soft, brown eyes were\r\nhumble whenever they met the eyes of Happy Jack. His smile was\r\ninfrequent and fleeting, and his voice more deprecating than ever.\r\nAside from these minor changes everything seemed the same as before\r\nthe sheepmen had stopped at camp.', 'That afternoon, however, came an aftermath in the shape of Happy Jack\r\ngalloping wildly out to where the others were holding a herd and\r\n"cutting out." He was due to come and help, so nobody paid any\r\nattention to his haste, though it was his habit to take his time. He\r\nshot recklessly by the outer fringes of the "cut" and yelled in a way\r\nto stampede the whole bunch. "Jakie\'s dying," he shouted, wild-eyed.\r\n"He\'s drunk up all the lemon extract and most uh the v\'nilla before I\r\ncould stop him!"', "Chip and Weary, riding in hot haste to the camp, found that it was\r\ntrue as far as the drinking was concerned. Jakie was stretched upon\r\nhis back breathing unpleasantly, and beside him were two flat bottles\r\nof half-pint size, one empty and the other very nearly so; the tent\r\nand Jakie's breath reeked of lemon and vanilla. Chip sent back for\r\nhelp.", 'For the second time the Flying U roundup was brought to an involuntary\r\npause because of its cook. There was but one thing to do, and Chip did\r\nit. He broke camp, loaded Jakie into the bed-wagon, and headed at a\r\ngallop for Dry Lake in an effort to catch the next train for Great\r\nFalls. Whether he sent Jakie to the hospital or to the undertaker was\r\na question he did not attempt to answer; one thing was certain,\r\nhowever, that he must send him to one of those places as soon as might\r\nbe.', 'That night, just before the train arrived, he sent another telegram to\r\nJohnny Scott at rush rates. He said simply:', '"Send another cook immediately this one all in am returning him in\r\n  baggage coach this train.', '"C. BENNETT."', 'Just after midnight he went to the station and received an answer,\r\nwhich is worth repeating:', '"C. BENNETT, Dry Lake: Supply cooks running low am sending only\r\n  available don\'t kill this one or may have to go without season on\r\n  cooks closed fine attached to killing, running with dogs or\r\n  keeping in captivity this one drunk look for him in Pullman have\r\n  bribed porter. \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 J.G. SCOTT."', 'It was sent collect, which accounts perhaps for the facetious remarks\r\nwhich it contained.', 'It was morning when that train arrived, because it was behind time\r\nfor some reason, but Chip, Weary, Pink and Big Medicine were at the\r\ndepot to meet it. The new cook having been reported drunk, they wanted\r\nto make sure of getting him off the train in case he proved unruly.\r\nThey were wise in the ways of intoxicated cooks. They ran to the steps\r\nof the only Pullman on the train and were met by the grinning porter.', '"Yas sah, he\'s in dah—but Ah cyan\'t git \'im off, sah, to save mah\r\nsoul," he explained toothily. "Ah put \'im next de front end, sah, but\r\nhe\'s went to sleep and Ah cyan\'t wake \'em up, an\' Ah cyan\'t tote \'em\r\nout nohow. Seems lak he weighs a ton!"', '"By cripes, we\'ll tote him out," declared Big Medicine, pushing\r\nahead of Chip in his enthusiasm. "You hold the train, and we\'ll git\r\n\'im. Show us the bunk."', 'The porter pointed out the number and retreated to the steps that he\r\nmight signal the conductor. The four pushed up through the vestibule\r\nand laid hold upon the berth curtains.', '"Mamma!" ejaculated Weary in a stunned tone. "Look what\'s in here,\r\nboys!"', 'They thrust forward their heads and peered in at the recumbent form.', '"Honest to grandma—it\'s old Patsy!" The voice of Big Medicine\r\nbrought heads out all along down the car.', '"Come out uh that!" Four voices made up the chorus, and Patsy opened\r\nhis eyes reluctantly.', '"Py cosh, I not cook chuck for you fellers ven I\'m sick," he mumbled\r\ndazedly.', '"Come out uh that, you damned Dutch belly-robber!" bawled Big Medicine\r\njoyously, and somewhere behind a curtain a feminine shriek was heard\r\nat the shocking sentence.', 'Four pairs of welcoming hands laid hold upon Patsy; four pairs of\r\nstrong arms dragged him out of the berth and through the narrow aisle\r\nto the platform. The conductor, the head brakeman and the porter were\r\nchafing there, and they pulled while the others pushed. So Patsy was\r\ndeposited upon the platform, grumbling and only half sober.', '"Anyway, we\'ve got him back," Weary remarked with much satisfaction\r\nthe next day when they were once more started toward the range land.\r\n"When Irish blows in again, we\'ll be all right."', '"By cripes, yuh just give me a sight uh that Irish once, and he\'ll\r\ncome, if I have to rope and drag \'im!" Big Medicine took his own way\r\nof intimating that he held no grudge. "Did yuh hear what Patsy said,\r\nby cripes, when he was loading up the chuck-wagon at the store? He\r\nturned in all that oil and them olives and anchovies, yuh know, and\r\nhe told Tom t\' throw in about six cases uh blueberries. I was standin\'\r\nright handy by, and he turns around and scowls at me and says: \'Py\r\ncosh, der vay dese fellers eats pie mit derselves, I have to fill oop\r\nder wagon mit pie fruit alreatty!\' And then the old devil turns around\r\nwith his back to me, but yuh can skin me for a coyote if I didn\'t\r\nketch a grin on \'is face!"', 'They turned and looked back to where Patsy, seated high upon the\r\nmess-wagon, was cracking his long whip like pistol shots and swearing\r\nin Dutch at his four horses as he came bouncing along behind them.', '"Well, there\'s worse fellers than old Patsy," Slim admitted\r\nponderously. "I don\'t want no more Jakie in mine, by golly."', '"I betche Jakie cashes in, with all that lemon in him," prophesied\r\nHappy Jack with relish. "Dirty little Dago—it\'d serve him right.\r\nPatsy wouldn\'t uh acted like that in a thousand years."', 'They glanced once more behind them, as if they would make sure that\r\nthe presence of Patsy was a reality. Then, with content in their\r\nhearts, they galloped blithely out of the lane and into the grassy\r\nhills.', '"\'Chip\' is all right.
