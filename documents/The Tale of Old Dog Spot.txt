SMITH', 'NEW YORK\r\nGROSSET & DUNLAP\r\nPUBLISHERS', 'Made in the United States of America', 'Copyright, 1921, by\r\nGROSSET & DUNLAP', 'Nobody ever spoke of old Spot\'s master\r\nas "old Johnnie Green." Yet the two—boy\r\nand dog—were almost exactly the\r\nsame age. Somehow Spot grew up faster\r\nthan Johnnie. He had stopped being a\r\npuppy by the time his young master\r\nlearned to walk. And when Johnnie was\r\nbig enough to play around the farm buildings\r\nhis parents felt sure that he was safe\r\nso long as "old Spot," as they called the\r\ndog, was with him.', 'Spot thought himself years older than\r\nthe small boy; or at least he always acted\r\nso. If a goose hissed at little, toddling\r\nJohnnie Green, old Spot would drive the\r\ngoose away, barking in a loud voice,\r\n"Don\'t you frighten this child!" If\r\nJohnnie went into the stable and wandered\r\nwithin reach of the horses\' heels\r\nSpot would take hold of his clothes and\r\ndraw him gently back out of danger.\r\nAnd if Johnnie strayed to the duck pond\r\nthe old dog wouldn\'t leave him even to\r\nchase the cat, but stayed right there by\r\nthe pond, ready to pull his young charge\r\nout of the water in case he happened to\r\nfall in.', "Spot seemed to enjoy his task of taking\r\ncare of Johnnie Green. It wasn't all\r\nwork. A great deal of pleasure went with\r\nhis duties, for Johnnie Green never\r\nwanted to do anything but play. And\r\nSpot wasn't so grown up that he couldn't\r\nenjoy a lively romp. For that matter, he\r\nnever did get over his liking for boisterous\r\nfun.", "Still, there were some kinds of sport\r\nthat he didn't care for. He wasn't fond\r\nof having such things as tin cans tied to\r\nhis tail. He disliked to be harnessed to a\r\ntoy wagon. He hated to have his ears\r\npulled. Yet there was only one offense\r\nthat ever made him growl. When Johnnie\r\nGreen took a bone away from him Spot\r\ncouldn't help warning him, with a deep,\r\nrumbling grumbling, that he was going\r\ntoo far, even between friends. But he\r\nnever snapped at Johnnie. That growling\r\nwas only Spot's way of teaching\r\nJohnnie Green manners.", "Fond as he was of his young master,\r\nSpot did not care to spend all his time\r\nplaying childish games. There were\r\ngrown-up things that he liked to do—things\r\nin which a toddler like Johnnie\r\nGreen couldn't take part. Around the\r\nfarmhouse there were always the cat to be\r\nteased and squirrels to be chased into\r\ntrees. In the pasture there were woodchucks\r\nto be hunted; and even if he\r\ncouldn't catch them it was fun to see\r\nthose fat fellows tumble into their\r\nholes.", 'Then there were the cows. Spot loved\r\nto help Farmer Green drive them home\r\nlate in the afternoon. He acted very important\r\nwhen he went for the cows, always\r\npretending that it was hard work, though\r\nhe really thought it great sport.', "Sometimes when Johnnie Green wanted\r\nto play with Spot the old dog couldn't be\r\nfound anywhere. He might be over the\r\nhill, visiting a neighbor's dog. He might\r\nbe in the woods, looking for birds. He\r\nmight even have followed a wagon to the\r\nvillage.", "As Johnnie Green grew older he roamed\r\nthrough the woods with Spot. And when\r\nJohnnie's father at last let him own a\r\ngun, old Spot was as pleased as Johnnie\r\nwas.", '"I\'ve been waiting for this event for\r\nseveral years," Spot told the Muley Cow.', 'She did not share his delight.', '"For pity\'s sake, keep that boy and his\r\ngun out of the pasture!" she bellowed.\r\n"It frightens me to have him come near\r\nme with his blunderbuss."', 'Old Spot gave her a pitying look.', '"It\'s plain," he said, "that you don\'t\r\ncome from a sporting family, as I do, or\r\nyou\'d never speak in that fashion of a\r\nnice new shotgun. You know I\'m a\r\nsporting dog. I\'m a pointer. I point out\r\nthe game for the hunters."', 'The Muley Cow gave a sort of snort\r\nand tossed her head.', '"It\'s lucky for Johnnie Green," she\r\nsniffed, "that I\'m not a sporting cow, or\r\nhe might not have any butter on his\r\nbread."', "When Miss Kitty Cat came to the farmhouse\r\nto live she soon showed old dog\r\nSpot that she could fight like a vixen.\r\nThe first time he cornered her she put\r\nsome scratches on his nose that he never\r\nforgot. And after that he always took\r\ngreat pains to keep out of reach of Miss\r\nKitty's claws.", 'So long as Miss Kitty Cat ran away\r\nfrom him Spot would follow her, yelping\r\nmadly. But when she stopped, he\r\nstopped too, digging his own claws into\r\nthe dirt in order to leave a safe distance\r\nbetween Miss Kitty and his nose.', "He quickly discovered that there were\r\nways in which he could tease Miss Kitty\r\nCat that annoyed her greatly, while keeping\r\nhis nose out of harm's way. Growling\r\nalways made her tail grow big.\r\nBarking made her spit at him. But there\r\nwas something else that angered her still\r\nmore. When Spot stood stock still one\r\nday, with his tail stuck straight out behind\r\nhim, and pointed at her with his nose,\r\nhe made her almost frantic.", '"What are you pointing at with that\r\nlong nose of yours?" Miss Kitty Cat\r\nsnarled.', "Spot didn't say a word. For the moment\r\nhe didn't move any more than the\r\niron dog did, that stood in a yard on the\r\noutskirts of the village and never so much\r\nas wagged his tail from one year's end to\r\nanother.", "Somehow Spot's queer behavior gave\r\nMiss Kitty Cat an odd, creepy feeling\r\nalong her back. Her fur rose on end.\r\nShe glared at Spot and spat at him in a\r\nmost unladylike fashion.", 'Spot found it very hard to stand still\r\nand never let out a single yelp. Once he\r\nalmost whined. But he managed to stifle\r\nthe sound.', '"If she swells up much more she\'s\r\nlikely to burst," he thought.', '"Go away!" Miss Kitty scolded.\r\n"Don\'t you know better than to stare at\r\na lady?"', 'Never an answer did old Spot make.', 'It was a little more than Miss Kitty\r\nCat could endure. With a yowl that had\r\nin it something of anger and something\r\nof fear, too, she jumped off the doorstep\r\nwhere she had been sitting and whisked\r\naround the corner of the house.', "With Miss Kitty's first leap Spot came\r\nsuddenly to life. He barked joyfully and\r\nfollowed her. Miss Kitty Cat ran up a\r\ntree in the yard and stayed there until\r\nSpot went off chuckling.", '"I\'m glad I played that trick on her,"\r\nhe said to himself. "It seems to bother\r\nher more than anything else I\'ve ever\r\ntried."', 'Thereafter Spot often pointed at Miss\r\nKitty when he met her, either inside the\r\nhouse or about the yard. And she never\r\nfailed to fly into a passion.', '"Such manners I never saw!" she\r\nspluttered when she talked one day with a\r\ncat from the nearest farmhouse.', '"I\'d soon cure the old dog of that unpleasant\r\ntrick if he tried it on me," her\r\nneighbor remarked.', '"What would you do?" Miss Kitty Cat\r\nwanted to know.', '"I\'d chase him."', '"He can run faster than I can," said\r\nMiss Kitty.', '"When he\'s pointing at you, jump at\r\nhim before he can turn around. If you\r\ndrag your claws across his nose just once\r\nhe\'ll be careful after that to look the\r\nother way when he sees you."', '"Your plan sounds as if it might be\r\nworth trying," said Miss Kitty thoughtfully.', 'Old dog Spot felt greatly pleased with\r\nhimself. He had told everybody that\r\nwould listen to him how he could make\r\nMiss Kitty Cat angry just by standing\r\nstill and pointing at her.', '"You\'d better leave that cat alone," the\r\nold horse Ebenezer advised him. "Don\'t\r\nyou remember how she clawed you when\r\nyou cornered her in this barn one day?"', '"I remember—yes!" Spot admitted, as\r\nhe looked cross-eyed at his nose, which\r\nstill bore the marks of Miss Kitty\'s claws.\r\n"I\'m careful not to stand too near her,"\r\nhe explained. "I don\'t try to grab her.\r\nI just stare at her. And she gets wild."', '"A wild cat," old Ebenezer warned\r\nhim, "is a dangerous creature."', '"Nonsense!" said Spot. "She always\r\nsneaks away after I\'ve pointed at her for\r\na few minutes. It\'s the funniest sight!\r\nIf you could see it once you\'d know she\r\nwas terribly afraid of me."', '"Nonsense!" said the old horse Ebenezer.\r\nBut he couldn\'t make Spot believe\r\nthere was the slightest danger in teasing\r\nMiss Kitty Cat.', '"She always runs up a tree after I\'ve\r\nbeen pointing at her," Spot went on.', '"You\'d better look out!" Ebenezer cautioned\r\nhim. "She\'ll have you climbing a\r\ntree the first thing you know."', "Well, that made Spot laugh. And he\r\nwent out of the barn feeling even more\r\npleased with himself than ever. He was\r\nsorry that Miss Kitty Cat wasn't in the\r\nyard. He felt just like bothering her.", '"I\'ll go up to the pasture and find me\r\na woodchuck to chase," Spot said to himself,\r\nfor he was in such high spirits that\r\nhe simply had to have fun of some sort.', 'First, however, he decided to stop and\r\ndig up a bone that he had buried in the\r\nflower garden. So he trotted across the\r\nyard. And as he drew near the farmhouse\r\nhe changed his plans all at once.\r\nHe forgot his bone and he forgot his\r\nwoodchuck, too. For he caught sight of\r\nsomething that had escaped his eye before.\r\nStretched on the ledge outside one of the\r\nkitchen windows Miss Kitty Cat was enjoying\r\na nap in the sunshine.', '"Aha!" said Spot very softly. "Aha!\r\nHere\'s a bit of luck." And he turned\r\nsharply aside and hurried towards the\r\nhouse, to come to a dead stop beneath the\r\nwindow and stand there motionless with\r\nhis nose pointing at the sleeping form of\r\nMiss Kitty.', "Though Spot didn't make the slightest\r\nnoise the sleeper suddenly opened her\r\neyes.", '"Tchah!" she exclaimed, springing to\r\nher feet and glaring at her annoyer.', "If the window hadn't been closed no\r\ndoubt Miss Kitty would have slipped\r\nthrough it into the kitchen. But there\r\nwas no escape that way.", '"It\'s a pity," she muttered, "that a\r\nperson can\'t take a cat nap without being\r\nstared at by this old dog. I think it\'s\r\nabout time I took my neighbor\'s advice\r\nand taught him to keep his eyes and his\r\nnose where they belong."', 'Then Miss Kitty Cat jumped. She\r\njumped off the window ledge straight at\r\nold dog Spot, who was still gazing up at\r\nher from below.', 'When he saw her coming he gave a\r\nstartled yelp and tried to dodge her. But\r\nhe was too slow. Miss Kitty Cat landed\r\nsquarely on his back and clawed him savagely.', 'Old Spot dashed half way across the\r\nfarmyard, then dropped suddenly and\r\nrolled over and over on the ground.', 'The next instant he was on his feet\r\nagain and tearing toward the barn.\r\nThough Miss Kitty had dropped off his\r\nback and was already on her way to the\r\nhouse he did not look around to see what\r\nhad become of her.', 'Spot bolted through the barn door and\r\nscurried into an empty stall, where he\r\njumped into the manger and cowered\r\ndown in the hay that half filled it, and\r\nmoaned.', 'It was the stall next to the old horse\r\nEbenezer\'s. And that mild fellow peered\r\nover at him in wonder. "What has happened?"\r\nhe inquired.', '"The cat scratched me," Spot told him.\r\n"I was teasing her and she wasn\'t at all\r\nnice about it."', '"What were you doing—pointing at\r\nher?" Ebenezer asked him.', '"Yes!"', '"I suppose it made her wild," the old\r\nhorse remarked. "And a wild cat is a\r\ndangerous creature."', "Spot whined fretfully. He wished he\r\ncould lick his wounds. But how can one\r\nlick scratches when they are behind one's\r\nears?", '"I was a wild dog for a few moments,"\r\nhe groaned. "I never dreamed she would\r\nplump down on me like that."', '"Haven\'t you ever heard of it\'s raining\r\ncats and dogs?" Ebenezer said. "Well,\r\nto-day it rained cats."', 'Farmer Green always had a woodpile in\r\nthe back yard. Sometimes it was big.\r\nSometimes it was little. Sometimes it\r\nwas mostly made up of four-foot logs.\r\nSometimes the logs were all split and\r\nsawed, ready to burn.', 'When Farmer Green and the hired\r\nman had nothing more pressing to do they\r\nset to work on the woodpile. It was surprising\r\nhow fast the big sticks grew into\r\nfirewood under their axes and saws.', 'One day they started sawing and splitting\r\nwhen Johnnie Green and old dog\r\nSpot were roaming through the woods.\r\nAnd when Johnnie and Spot came back\r\nhome, just in time for dinner, they found\r\na great heap of firewood lying on the\r\nground where there had been nothing but\r\ndirt when they started for the woods some\r\nhours before.', 'Old dog Spot ran straight to the woodpile\r\nand began sniffing and scratching and\r\nwhining.', "If Johnnie Green hadn't been hungry\r\nhe would have paid more heed to Spot's\r\nbehavior. But the men had already gone\r\ninto the house. And Johnnie hurried\r\nafter them, leaving Spot to nose about the\r\nwoodpile as he pleased.", '"Humph!" Spot growled. "Seems to\r\nme Johnnie Green might stay here a while\r\nand help me. I\'ve been chasing woodchucks\r\nand squirrels for him all the morning.\r\nAnd I showed him a few birds,\r\ntoo."', 'Spot never once left the woodpile while\r\nJohnnie was eating his dinner. When\r\nJohnnie and his father and the hired man\r\ncame out of the house later old Spot began\r\nto yelp. He made frantic efforts to burrow\r\ndown beneath the pile of firewood,\r\nstopping now and then to run up to his\r\nyoung master and bark.', 'Now that he had had his dinner, Johnnie\r\nGreen was all ready for any sort of\r\nfun.', '"Spot smells some kind of game in the\r\nwoodpile!" Johnnie exclaimed.', '"Perhaps he does," said his father.\r\n"But I don\'t see how he\'s going to get\r\nhold of it unless we move the woodpile.\r\nAnd I don\'t believe we\'ll quit work to help\r\nthe old dog catch a chipmunk—or maybe\r\na rat."', '"Come on!" Spot begged Johnnie, as\r\nplainly as he could bark. "Move some of\r\nthis wood for me! There\'s something\r\nunder it that I want to get my teeth on."', '"All right! All right!" Johnnie told\r\nhim. And to his father Johnnie said,\r\n"Do you care if I throw some of the stove\r\nwood over on the other side of the pile?"', '"If you\'re going to move any wood—"\r\nFarmer Green replied with a wink at the\r\nhired man—"if you\'re going to move any\r\nwood you might as well move it into the\r\nwoodshed and pile it up neatly."', "When he heard that suggestion Johnnie\r\nGreen looked very glum. For a minute\r\nor two he thought he wouldn't bother to\r\nhelp old Spot find what he was looking\r\nfor. But Spot teased and teased. And\r\nJohnnie couldn't help being curious to\r\nknow what it was that Spot was after.", '"Maybe there\'s a muskrat here," he\r\nsaid to himself. "If there is, I\'ll have\r\nhis skin to pay me for my trouble."', "Old Spot wouldn't let Johnnie Green\r\nalone. He kept jumping against him and\r\nwhining, begging him to move some of the\r\nwood, because there was something very,\r\nvery interesting beneath it.", "Still Johnnie hesitated. He hadn't intended\r\nto do any work that afternoon.", '"After all," he thought, "I\'ll have to\r\nhelp carry in this wood sooner or later.\r\nReally, I might as well take some of it\r\ninto the woodshed now."', "To Spot's delight he bent over and began\r\ngathering an armful of wood.", '"Wow! Wow!" Spot howled. "Thank\r\ngoodness I\'m going to get what\'s under\r\nthis pile, after all."', 'Johnnie Green carried armful after\r\narmful of wood from the yard and piled\r\nit in the shed back of the kitchen. All\r\nthe time old dog Spot was urging him\r\nwith yelps and barks and whines and\r\nmoans to move faster. And all the time\r\nJohnnie Green was working as spryly as\r\nhe could.', "Whatever it might be that Spot wanted\r\nto get under the woodpile in the yard,\r\nJohnnie hoped it wouldn't escape through\r\nthe crevices between the sticks.", '"I don\'t want to get myself all tired\r\nout for nothing," Johnnie said to himself.\r\n"I was going fishing this afternoon."', 'While Johnnie hurried back and forth\r\nbetween the woodpile and the shed Spot\r\nclawed away at the edge of the pile. He\r\nthrust his nose beneath loose sticks and\r\npushed them about. He uttered pitiful\r\nsounds.', '"I never saw that dog take on so,"\r\nFarmer Green remarked.', '"And I never saw Johnnie work so\r\nhard," said the hired man. "When\r\nthere\'s wood to be carried in he\'s usually\r\na mile away."', 'Farmer Green laughed.', '"He\'ll quit as soon as Spot gets what\r\nhe wants," he replied. "It\'s too bad this\r\nsort of thing doesn\'t happen oftener.\r\nExcept for driving the cows home, this is\r\nthe first time I ever knew a boy and a dog\r\nto do much besides play, when they\'re\r\ntogether."', 'Turkey Proudfoot, the huge gobbler,\r\ncame hurrying around the corner of the\r\nbarn to see what was going on. He had\r\nan idea that he ruled the farmyard.', '"What\'s all this row about?" he gobbled\r\nat old Spot. "Have you lost something?"', '"Yes!" Spot told him. "Johnnie\r\nGreen\'s helping me to find it. We\'re\r\nmoving part of the woodpile."', '"What did you lose?" Turkey Proudfoot\r\ndemanded.', 'Old Spot pretended not to hear him.\r\nHe began barking again at Johnnie\r\nGreen.', "Mr. Catbird, who loved to play jokes on\r\neverybody, started mewing from his hiding\r\nplace under the lilac bushes. He had\r\nnoticed Spot's antics. And he hoped to\r\nfool him into thinking there was a strange\r\ncat around the place. For Spot was a\r\nfamous chaser of all cats—so long as they\r\nkept running away from him and didn't\r\nturn around and try to scratch him.", "To Mr. Catbird's astonishment old Spot\r\npaid no heed to his catcalls.", '"This is queer," Mr. Catbird muttered.\r\n"Whenever I\'ve mewed before he has always\r\ncome a-running. There must be\r\nsomething uncommonly interesting under\r\nthat woodpile."', 'Henrietta Hen, who was one of the busiest\r\nbusybodies on the farm, came along\r\nand stood and watched old dog Spot while\r\nhe dug and scratched and howled about\r\nthe woodpile.', '"What on earth is the matter with\r\nyou?" she asked him. "I don\'t make\r\nhalf that fuss when I\'ve just laid an egg\r\nand really have something to cackle\r\nabout."', '"I\'ve no time to talk with you now,"\r\nSpot told Henrietta Hen. "Can\'t you see\r\nthat Johnnie Green and I are moving the\r\nwoodpile?"', '"Why are you doing that?" Henrietta\r\ninquired.', '"There\'s something beneath it that I\r\nwant," he said hurriedly.', 'Henrietta Hen gave a sudden start.', '"I wonder if it\'s a weasel!" she exclaimed.\r\nAnd since he didn\'t reply, and\r\nshe had learned to be mortally afraid of\r\nweasels, she ran off squawking, to hide\r\nhigh up in the haymow in the barn.', "Johnnie Green hadn't carried away\r\nmuch more of the woodpile when old dog\r\nSpot began to dig furiously in the dirt.\r\nAnd in a few seconds' time he unearthed\r\na big bone.", 'It was a choice bone. He had buried\r\nit several days before. And when he\r\ncame back from the woods and found a\r\nwoodpile on top of the place where he had\r\nhidden it, it was no wonder that he made\r\nsuch a howdy-do.', 'Johnnie Green looked much upset as he\r\nstood stock still and saw Spot trot away\r\nwith the bone in his mouth.', '"So that was what he was after all the\r\ntime!" he cried at last. "I hoped it was\r\na muskrat."', 'His father and the hired man laughed\r\nand laughed.', '"I don\'t see any joke," Johnnie grumbled.\r\n"Here I\'ve piled up wood enough\r\nin the shed to last a month. And I might\r\nhave been fishing all the time."', '"Well," said his father, "whose fault\r\nis it?"', '"Old Spot\'s, I should think!" Johnnie\r\nreplied.', '"I don\'t see how you can blame him,"\r\nsaid Farmer Green. "Suppose you had\r\nburied a piece of strawberry shortcake\r\nhere, expecting to eat it for your dinner.\r\nAnd suppose there wasn\'t another piece\r\nas good—or as big—to be had anywhere.\r\nAnd suppose you had come back from a\r\ntramp in the woods, hungry as—well, hungry\r\nas you were this noon. Wouldn\'t you\r\nwant that piece of shortcake? If you\r\ncould get old Spot to move the wood off it,\r\nwouldn\'t you be glad to have him do it?"', '"Maybe!" Johnnie admitted. "Maybe!\r\nBut Spot wasn\'t after a piece of\r\nstrawberry shortcake. He was after an\r\nold bone. And he fooled me."', '"I should say that you fooled yourself,"\r\nhis father retorted. "Anyhow,\r\nwe\'re going to have strawberry shortcake\r\nfor supper to-night. I heard your\r\nmother say so. And she made a special\r\ncake for you."', 'That news made Johnnie Green look a\r\ngood deal less gloomy. In fact he almost\r\nsmiled.', '"I was going to give you that old fishing\r\nrod of mine if you\'d help carry in the\r\nwood," Farmer Greene went on. "And\r\nyou could take it now and go fishing, if\r\nyou thought you could be home in time for\r\nsupper."', '"Hurrah!" Johnnie Green suddenly\r\njumped up and down. "Hurrah!" he\r\ncried. "And thank you very much!"', 'And when, an hour later, old Spot came\r\nswimming across the creek and joined\r\nJohnnie on the further bank, and shook\r\ndrops of water all over his young master,\r\nJohnnie Green only patted him and called\r\nhim a "good old fellow."', 'Old dog Spot liked boys. Somehow they\r\nalways managed to have a lively time; and\r\nusually they seemed glad to have him join\r\nthem in their sports.', "He never could understand why Johnnie\r\nGreen and the neighbors' boys didn't\r\nwant him to play baseball with them.\r\nSpot loved to chase a ball. And sometimes\r\nwhen he was watching a game and\r\nsomebody hit a slow grounder he would\r\nrush out and grab the ball and run\r\nwith it.", 'Then all the boys would run after him\r\nand try to catch him. That always\r\npleased Spot mightily. And the longer\r\nthe chase lasted the happier he was. But\r\nit was different with the boys. The\r\nharder they had to run after Spot before\r\nthey got the ball away from him the more\r\nout of patience they became.', 'Whenever Spot took part in a ball game\r\nlike that Johnnie Green usually put an\r\nend to his fun, for the time being, by tying\r\nhim to something or other—perhaps a\r\nfence or a tree. But even that was better—so\r\nSpot thought—than being sent\r\nhome in disgrace.', "Luckily there were other sports in\r\nwhich Spot could romp with the boys as\r\nmuch as he pleased, without anybody's\r\nobjecting. Nutting in the woods in the\r\nfall; skating on the mill pond or coasting\r\ndown the long hill past Farmer Green's\r\nhouse in the winter; berrying in the summer—and\r\nswimming! Those were only a\r\nfew of the jolly times that Spot and the\r\nboys enjoyed together.", "Perhaps, of them all, both Spot and the\r\nboys liked swimming the most. As for\r\nSpot, he didn't care where he swam, so\r\nlong as the water was wet. Broad Brook,\r\nSwift River, Black Creek, or the mill\r\npond—any one of those places suited him\r\nas well as another. The boys, however,\r\npreferred the mill pond. It was deep\r\nenough, by the dam, to suit the best swimmers;\r\nand it was shallow enough at the\r\nupper end for those that were just\r\nlearning.", 'All the boys thought it great fun when\r\na wagon clattered over the bridge, which\r\ncrossed right above the dam. Then they\r\nducked into the water, with only their\r\nheads out, and shouted more or less politely\r\nat whoever was passing.', 'At such times Spot barked, because that\r\nseemed to him the gentlemanly thing to\r\ndo. But he never could see any sense in\r\njumping into the water if he happened to\r\nbe out on the bank when a wagon came\r\nalong.', 'The boys threw sticks about the pond\r\nfor Spot to fetch back to them. They\r\nraced with him. They upset him when he\r\nwas sunning himself on the big rock near\r\nthe dam, and they laughed to see the\r\nsplash he made when he struck the water.', "No matter what tricks the boys played\r\non him, Spot never lost his temper. He\r\ntook everything good-naturedly. And\r\none day, when Johnnie Green and his\r\nfriends were swimming in the mill pond\r\nhe even took a bundle of clothes from\r\nbeneath a big hickory on the bank. Yes!\r\nSpot caught up somebody's clothes in his\r\nmouth and started along the road with\r\nthem.", 'He was surprised to hear a terrible outcry\r\nfrom the water.', "Old dog Spot was trotting down the road\r\nfrom the mill pond, carrying a bundle of\r\nsomebody's clothes in his mouth. When\r\nhe heard frantic shouts from the water,\r\nwhere Johnnie Green and his friends were\r\nswimming, he quickened his pace.", 'One of the swimmers was known as\r\n"Red." And it was a favorite trick of\r\nhis to tie hard knots in other boys\' garments\r\nwhile the owners of them were in\r\nthe pond. Usually he wet the knots, because\r\nwetting them made them harder to\r\nuntie.', "On this day somebody had turned the\r\ntables on Red. Somebody had crept up\r\nbehind the big old hickory tree on the\r\nbank and had knotted Red's clothes tightly.\r\nThat was why old Spot found a bundle\r\nunder the tree, all tied up and ready\r\nto carry off.", 'It was no wonder that the boys began\r\nto yell when they saw Spot pick up those\r\nclothes and calmly trot away with them.\r\nIt was no wonder that they swam to the\r\nbank and scrambled up to the big hickory\r\nto find out whose clothes were missing.', 'When they saw that Red was the unlucky\r\none, everybody else began to whoop\r\nand laugh.', 'But not Red! He let out a frightened\r\nscream and started to follow old dog Spot.', "To the great delight of his companions,\r\nthe rattle of a wagon and the thud of a\r\nhorse's feet sounded from up the road.\r\nAnd since some one must soon drive over\r\nthe bridge, which crossed right above the\r\ndam, Red scurried back again and dived\r\ninto the pond, into which Johnnie Green\r\nand the others had already plunged.", 'Red rose to the surface spluttering.\r\nAnd finding that he could touch bottom\r\nwith his feet, he stood with his carroty\r\nhead out of water, watching for the\r\nwagon.', 'It soon came into view, out of the woods,\r\nand the horse that drew it thundered upon\r\nthe bridge. The horse was old Ebenezer;\r\nand Farmer Green was driving him.', '"Hi!" Red shouted. "Stop! Wait a\r\nminute!"', "Johnnie Green's father pulled Ebenezer\r\nto a halt.", '"What\'s going on here?" he inquired.', '"Spot took my clothes," Red explained.\r\n"He\'s run down the road with them. Get\r\nthem for me—please!"', "Hoots and catcalls from the other boys\r\nfollowed Red's speech, which was a wonderfully\r\npolite one—for him.", "Farmer Green couldn't help laughing.", '"I\'m going to the village," he said.\r\n"If I find any clothes along the road I\'ll\r\npick them up and put them in the wagon.\r\nAnd if you\'re here when I come back I\'ll\r\ngive them to you."', '"He\'ll be here!" Johnnie Green\r\nshouted. "Red\'ll wait for you."', '"If you hurry, maybe you can catch\r\nSpot," Red called to Farmer Green as\r\nhe drove off. "I can\'t stay here all day."', '"You\'ll have to," the boys jeered.', '"Maybe you\'ll have to wait here till\r\ndark," Johnnie Green suggested.', '"I won\'t!" Red replied, as he swam\r\ntowards the bank. "Your dog took my\r\nclothes," he cried as he ran up to the big\r\nhickory. "And I\'m going to take yours."', "It was Johnnie's turn to yell then. He\r\nwas on the further side of the mill pond.\r\nAnd long before he could cross it Red had\r\nsnatched up Johnnie's clothes from the\r\nshade of the hickory and dodged into the\r\nbushes with them.", "Old dog Spot was trotting down the road\r\nwith the bundle of clothes in his mouth—the\r\nclothes which belonged to Johnnie\r\nGreen's friend Red, who was one of the\r\nswimming party in the mill pond.", "Somewhat to Spot's surprise the boys\r\nhad not come tearing down the road after\r\nhim.", '"It\'s queer," he said to himself.\r\n"I wonder why they don\'t follow me. This\r\nwould be fun if they\'d only chase me."', 'Just then he happened to spy a squirrel\r\non a stone wall. Spot promptly made for\r\nthis gentleman. Keeping a firm hold on\r\nhis bundle, he plunged through a tangle\r\nof blackberry bushes that grew beside the\r\nroad.', "The thorny brambles caught at Spot's\r\nbundle and held it fast.", '"G-r-r-r!" he growled. "I don\'t want\r\nto lose sight of that fat fellow. Unless\r\nI\'m mistaken, it was Frisky Squirrel.\r\nAnd I\'ve had an eye out for him for a\r\nlongtime."', 'After a few frantic tugs he let go of the\r\nbundle of clothes and dashed after the\r\nsquirrel.', 'It was Frisky Squirrel. He ran up a\r\ntree while Spot was struggling in the\r\nblackberry thicket. And he scampered\r\nfrom one tree top to another while Spot\r\nfollowed beneath him, barking furiously.', 'At last Frisky stopped and sat on a\r\nlimb, to chatter and scold at old dog Spot.', '"What are you doing so far from\r\nhome?" he demanded after a while.', '"I\'ve been swimming in the mill pond\r\nwith the boys," said old dog Spot.', '"Then you\'d better go back there at\r\nonce, unless you want a punishing later,"\r\nFrisky Squirrel told him. "I can hear\r\nthem whistling for you."', "It wasn't far from the mill pond—that\r\nplace where they were talking, for Spot's\r\nchase of Frisky Squirrel had led him back\r\nup the hill again. Now Spot cocked his\r\near in the direction of the pond and listened.\r\nSure enough! he could hear\r\nJohnnie Green's whistle.", '"I\'ll see you again," he told Frisky\r\nSquirrel.', '"Not if I see you first!" Frisky muttered\r\nas old Spot started through the\r\nwoods for the mill pond.', '"Come here!" Johnnie Green greeted\r\nhim sternly when, a few minutes later, he\r\nappeared on the bank. "Where are those\r\nclothes that you took?"', "Spot wagged his tail. He acted very,\r\nvery friendly. Nobody would have supposed,\r\nfrom his looks, that he had stolen\r\nanyone's clothes.", '"This is no joke," Johnnie Green declared.\r\n"I haven\'t anything to wear.\r\nGet those clothes and bring them back\r\nhere!"', '"I don\'t know what\'s the matter with\r\nJohnnie," Spot thought. "I didn\'t touch\r\nhis things. I don\'t see why he\'s so\r\nangry."', '"Good old Spot!" Johnnie coaxed.\r\n"Find the clothes! There\'s a good fellow!"', 'He waded toward the bank and snapped\r\nhis fingers at Spot.', 'The old dog edged away. Johnnie\r\ntalked pleasantly enough. But he had a\r\nqueer look in his eye. Spot thought it\r\nsafer to keep out of his clutches.', 'Just then the miller came driving up\r\nthe hill on a load of corn. When he saw\r\nthe boys in the pond he stopped his\r\nhorses.', '"Anybody here lost any clothes?" he\r\nasked, holding a bundle up in his hand.\r\n"I found these by the side of the road. I\r\nnoticed them hanging on a blackberry\r\nbush."', '"I\'ll take \'em!" Johnnie Green cried.\r\n"They belong to Red. But you can leave\r\nthem with me."', 'The miller tossed the bundle to him.', "The boy Red, wearing Johnnie's clothes,\r\nwas watching everything that went on,\r\nfrom behind a tree. He waited until\r\nJohnnie had untied the hard, wet knots in\r\nthe clothes. Then he stepped out from his\r\nhiding place.", '"Let\'s swap!" he said. And while\r\nthey were swapping, old dog Spot took a\r\nswim in the mill pond. Somehow he felt\r\nthat all was well again.', 'On the table in the kitchen of the farmhouse\r\nwas a leg of mutton. Farmer\r\nGreen had left it there and gone away.\r\nAnd Mrs. Green had stepped out of the\r\nkitchen—nobody knew for how long.', "At least old dog Spot and Miss Kitty\r\nCat didn't know. They were left there\r\nin the kitchen alone—alone with the leg\r\nof mutton.", '"Ahem!" said Miss Kitty Cat to old\r\ndog Spot. "Don\'t you think you\'d better\r\ngo and see what\'s become of Farmer\r\nGreen?"', 'She was unusually pleasant, for her.\r\nAs a rule she had little to say to Spot, except\r\nto scold at him.', '"I\'m comfortable here, thank you,"\r\nSpot answered. "Farmer Green must be\r\nout of sight by this time. So I won\'t\r\nbother to chase after him."', '"You could smell out his track, couldn\'t\r\nyou?" Miss Kitty Cat suggested.', '"Perhaps!" said Spot. "Perhaps!\r\nBut as I said, I\'m comfortable here. I\'m\r\ngoing to stay right here in the kitchen."\r\nOut of the corner of his eye he looked at\r\nMiss Kitty Cat. He could see that she\r\nwas somewhat displeased by something or\r\nother. Her tail was beginning to swell\r\nslightly. And that was a sure sign that\r\nshe was losing her temper. But when she\r\nspoke again her voice was as sweet as\r\nhoney.', '"What a beautiful day to go hunting!"\r\nshe remarked as she sprang into a chair\r\nbeside the window and looked out. "The\r\nwoods must be full of birds."', '"No doubt!" said Spot dryly. "I went\r\nhunting early this morning; and there was\r\nplenty of game then."', '"Ha!" Miss Kitty exclaimed suddenly.\r\n"Do I hear the cows in the cornfield?"', 'Now, Spot loved to drive the cows out\r\nof the corn. But for a wonder, he never\r\neven moved an ear.', '"I hope the sheep haven\'t scrambled\r\nover the stone wall," Miss Kitty Cat\r\nmewed. "If they have, Farmer Green\r\nwould want you to get them back into the\r\npasture for him."', '"Yes!" said Spot with a yawn. "I\'m\r\nsure he would. And if he needs me he\r\nknows where he can find me."', "Miss Kitty Cat's tail was growing bigger\r\nevery moment. And the fur on her\r\nback was beginning to stand on end. Still\r\nshe managed to speak in her very softest\r\nvoice.", '"Did you know—" she inquired—"did\r\nyou know that Johnnie Green had gone\r\nswimming in the mill pond?"', '"No!" said Spot. "Has he? I hope\r\nhe\'ll have a good time. I had a fine swim\r\nyesterday in Black Creek. And I almost\r\ncaught a muskrat there."', 'As he spoke he rose and walked across\r\nthe big, square kitchen and stretched himself\r\nout on the floor right in front of the\r\ntable where the leg of mutton lay.', 'At that Miss Kitty Cat gave a terrible\r\ncry of rage.', '"I know why you won\'t leave the\r\nkitchen!" she yowled. "You think I\'m\r\ngoing to eat some of that mutton. And\r\nthat\'s why you\'ve lain down alongside it."', "Old dog Spot never moved from the place\r\nwhere he was lying in front of the kitchen\r\ntable. Although Miss Kitty Cat had told\r\nhim angrily that he thought she was going\r\nto enjoy a luncheon on the leg of mutton\r\nthat was on the kitchen table, he didn't\r\nlose his temper.", '"Pardon me!" he said. "You are mistaken.\r\nI don\'t think you\'re going to have\r\neven a taste of this mutton—not while\r\nI\'m in the kitchen!"', "Miss Kitty Cat was furious. She had\r\ndone her best to make Spot go away. She\r\nhad dropped a number of hints to get him\r\nout of doors. But Spot hadn't taken a\r\nsingle one of them.", '"You\'re a meddlesome old dog," she\r\nscolded. "I\'ve a good mind to drag my\r\nclaws across your nose."', 'Spot grinned at her.', '"If you do," he warned her, "I shall\r\nyelp. Then Mrs. Green will hurry back\r\nhere to see what\'s going on. And you certainly\r\nwon\'t get any mutton while she\'s in\r\nthe kitchen. I happen to know that the\r\nfamily\'s going to have that leg of mutton\r\nfor dinner to-morrow."', '"There ought to be enough of it for\r\neverybody," Miss Kitty Cat grumbled.\r\n"If I ate a bit of it nobody would ever\r\nmiss it. And after I\'ve finished my meal\r\nthere would be nothing to prevent your\r\nhelping yourself. I certainly shouldn\'t\r\nstand in your way—nor lie in it, either."', "Old dog Spot couldn't help sniffing.", '"I never snatch any food when Mrs.\r\nGreen\'s back is turned," he told Miss\r\nKitty Cat severely. "She feeds me all\r\nshe thinks I ought to eat. And if I want\r\nmore, I hunt for it in the woods and\r\nfields."', '"Don\'t I hunt?" Miss Kitty Cat hissed.\r\n"I keep the house free of rats and mice.\r\nMrs. Green could well spare me a bit of\r\nthat mutton in return for all I do for\r\nher.... I\'ll thank you, sir, to move away\r\nfrom that table!"', "Old Spot began to look somewhat\r\nanxious. He had once felt Miss Kitty's\r\nsharp claws on his nose. And he didn't\r\ncare to be scratched by her again. But\r\nthere was the leg of mutton! He had to\r\nguard that for Mrs. Green.", '"I wish Mrs. Green would come back,"\r\nhe said to himself. "I don\'t want a row\r\nwith this Cat person."', 'Miss Kitty suddenly spat at him.', 'Spot knew that that was a danger sign.\r\nAnd he gave a few short, sharp barks.', '"There!" he muttered. "That ought\r\nto fetch Mrs. Green. If she\'s in the house\r\nshe can\'t help hearing me."', "Spot was right. In about a minute\r\nFarmer Green's wife came hurrying into\r\nthe kitchen.", 'Old dog Spot jumped up and wagged\r\nhis tail and gave a low-pitched bark as if\r\nto say, "I\'ve saved your leg of mutton\r\nfor you, Mrs. Green."', "But she didn't understand him.", '"You rascal!" Mrs. Green exclaimed.\r\n"You\'ve been teasing the cat again. I\r\ncan tell by the way she acts. Out you\r\ngo!" And she opened the door.', 'Spot went.', "Poor Spot! He felt so mournful that he\r\nlifted up his muzzle and howled. Farmer\r\nGreen's wife had just ordered him out of\r\nthe kitchen. She thought he had been\r\nteasing Miss Kitty Cat. And instead he\r\nhad kept Miss Kitty from tasting the leg\r\nof mutton that lay on the kitchen table.", '"It\'s a sad, sad world!" he howled. "I\r\nthought Mrs. Green would praise me.\r\nBut she didn\'t. She scolded me!"', '"Sakes alive!" cried Henrietta Hen as\r\nshe rushed up to him in the farmyard.\r\n"What\'s the matter with you? Are you\r\ntrying to bay the moon in the daytime?"', 'Turkey Proudfoot gobbled at Spot and\r\nbade him be still. Turkey Proudfoot was\r\nvery pompous, for he had an idea that he\r\nruled the farmyard.', "Old dog Spot felt so meek, after the\r\nscolding that Mrs. Green gave him, that\r\nhe couldn't find a word to say to anybody\r\nthat spoke to him.", '"I\'ve expected this for some time," the\r\nRooster told Henrietta Hen. "Mrs.\r\nGreen has put old Spot out of the farmhouse.\r\nAnd Farmer Green intends to put\r\nhim off the farm. Everyone agrees that\r\nhe\'s a nuisance. It\'s a wonder the folks\r\nin the Green family have kept him all\r\nthese years."', "Well, old dog Spot couldn't help hearing\r\nwhat the Rooster said. And he hadn't\r\neven heart enough to answer that impertinent\r\nboaster.", '"Maybe he knows what he\'s talking\r\nabout," Spot groaned. "I wish Johnnie\r\nGreen would come home. He\'d stand up\r\nfor me, if nobody else will."', "Then something happened all at once\r\nthat helped Spot's spirits amazingly.\r\nThe woodshed door flew open and Miss\r\nKitty Cat all but flew out of it. Farmer\r\nGreen's wife appeared in the doorway\r\nwith a broom in her hand. And with it\r\nshe helped Miss Kitty into the yard. She\r\nhelped her so much that Miss Kitty never\r\ntouched the broad stone doorstep at all.", '"Scat!" cried Mrs. Green. "I don\'t\r\nwant any thieves in my kitchen."', 'It was quite plain that something had\r\ndispleased Mrs. Green—something in\r\nwhich Miss Kitty Cat had had a part.\r\nAnd old dog Spot thought he knew what\r\nthat something was.', '"Ha!" he barked at Miss Kitty. "So\r\nMrs. Green found you out!" And he ran\r\nat Miss Kitty and chased her into a tree.\r\nShe sat herself down upon a limb and\r\nglared at him.', '"Wow!" he yelped. "You must have\r\nsampled that leg of mutton when you\r\nthought Mrs. Green\'s back was turned.\r\nAnd she must have caught you in the act."', "Though that was exactly what had happened,\r\nMiss Kitty Cat wouldn't say a\r\nword. But she looked whole sentences\r\nat him.", 'Soon Farmer Green\'s wife came to the\r\ndoor again and called, "Come, Spot!\r\nCome, Spot!"', 'He hurried up to her and caught the\r\npiece of meat that she tossed to him.', 'It was mutton.', 'To please old dog Spot Johnnie Green\r\nhad only to ask him this question, "Want\r\nto go hunting, Spot?"', "When he heard that, Spot would leave\r\nanything he happened to be doing, or give\r\nup anything he had intended to do. Perhaps\r\nhe had expected to dig up and gnaw\r\na choice bone that he had buried somewhere.\r\nIt might be that he had been\r\nplanning to chase the cat, or tease Turkey\r\nProudfoot in order to hear him gobble.\r\nThere wasn't one of those pleasures that\r\nSpot wouldn't gladly forgo for the sake of\r\ngoing hunting with Johnnie Green.", "When Johnnie Green's father first gave\r\nhim a shotgun Spot went almost frantic\r\nwith delight. And they lost no time in\r\nstarting for the woods. Johnnie Green\r\ntrudged up the lane with the gun on his\r\nshoulder, while Spot ran on ahead of him,\r\nreturning now and then as if to urge\r\nJohnnie to hurry.", "They hadn't been long in the woods\r\nwhen Spot suddenly stood still and\r\npointed ahead of him with his nose.", "Try as he would, Johnnie couldn't see\r\nwhat Spot was pointing at. So he took a\r\nfew steps forward until he came abreast\r\nof the old dog. Then all at once there\r\nwas a rumbling whir that sounded to\r\nJohnnie Green almost as loud as thunder.\r\nA brownish streak flashed from the\r\nground just ahead of him.", 'He knew that it was a grouse rising.\r\nAnd he fired.', 'Johnnie Green missed the bird. It had\r\ngiven him such a start that he was still\r\nshaking long afterward. He was disappointed,\r\nbut not less downcast than old\r\nSpot.', '"Never mind, old boy!" Johnnie said.\r\n"We\'ll have better luck next time!"', "But they didn't. Twice more that\r\nsame thing happened. And after the\r\nthird miss old Sport turned tail and ran\r\naway.", '"I don\'t see what\'s the matter with that\r\nboy," he muttered. "I\'ve pointed three\r\nbirds for him. And he has let every one\r\nof them get away.... There\'s no fun in\r\nthat kind of shooting."', "After that Johnnie couldn't get Spot to\r\ngo into the woods with him. Whenever\r\nJohnnie appeared in the yard with his\r\ngun, Spot promptly vanished.", "So Johnnie spent a good deal of time\r\nshooting at old tin cans which he set on\r\na fence post or a stone wall. And it\r\nwasn't long before he found he could hit\r\nthem at every shot.", 'At last he came home from the woods\r\none day with a grouse. When he showed\r\nit to Spot the old dog actually began teasing\r\nhim to go hunting.', 'The next day they set out together for\r\nthe woods. And Johnnie knocked down\r\nthe very first grouse that Spot found for\r\nhim.', 'Spot brought the bird to Johnnie and\r\nlaid it proudly at his feet.', '"Did Johnnie Green ever give you any\r\nof the birds that you find for him?" Miss\r\nKitty Cat inquired when Spot was boasting\r\na bit about the sport he and Johnnie\r\nhad in the woods. "No!" she said, answering\r\nher own question. "You\'re silly\r\nto hunt for him. I prefer to do my hunting\r\nalone. Then nobody can take the\r\ngame away from me."', 'Old dog Spot walked away from her, to\r\nthe barn.', '"Miss Kitty Cat doesn\'t know what real\r\nhunting is," he told the old horse Ebenezer.\r\n"She creeps up on small birds after\r\ndark, when they are asleep."', '"And you creep up on big birds in the\r\ndaytime," said old Ebenezer, "so Johnnie\r\nGreen can shoot them."', "Being a sporting dog, Spot couldn't see\r\nanything queer in that remark.", '"Certainly!" he said.', "Johnnie Green went visiting one summer,\r\nafter haying was done. Much to\r\nold dog Spot's disgust, Johnnie did not\r\ntake him on this journey. But it was not\r\nSpot's fault that he was left at home.\r\nHad he not been shut up in the harness\r\nroom in the barn when Johnnie drove\r\nthe old horse Ebenezer out of the yard\r\nSpot would have followed beneath the\r\nbuggy.", "It was hours before Farmer Green set\r\nSpot free. When Farmer Green at last\r\nflung open the door of the harness room\r\nSpot rushed out and dashed into the road.\r\nTo his sorrow he couldn't smell a trace of\r\nEbenezer's track. So many other horses\r\nhad passed by the house since morning\r\nthat Spot couldn't even tell which way\r\nEbenezer had gone.", 'In desperation Spot ran up the road a\r\nlittle way. Then he turned around and\r\nran down the hill as far as the gristmill.', 'By the time he reached the mill pond\r\nSpot gave up the chase. He knew it was\r\nhopeless.', "And seeing several of Johnnie Green's\r\nfriends swimming in the pond, he joined\r\nthem.", "The boys welcomed him with shouts.\r\nAnd the water was just as cool as ever.\r\nBut somehow Spot didn't find swimming\r\nas pleasant as he always had before. He\r\nmissed Johnnie Green. There wasn't\r\nanother boy there that gave Spot the same\r\nthrill by whistling to him, or patting him,\r\nor romping with him that Johnnie Green\r\ngave him.", "After a while Spot shook himself and\r\ntrotted back to Farmer Green's place.\r\nHe felt homesick. But when he reached\r\nthe house somehow he felt worse than\r\never. It was terribly quiet. It was just\r\nlike a Sunday morning, when everybody\r\nwas at church. Farmer Green and the\r\nhired man were working in the fields.\r\nMrs. Green was busy in the house—too\r\nbusy to stop and talk with old Spot.", '"It\'s frightfully dull here," Spot\r\ngroaned. "I wish somebody would\r\nshout." And just to break the silence he\r\nlifted up his nose and tried to bark.', 'It was far from a cheerful noise that\r\nhe made, for he only succeeded in giving\r\na mournful howl. And that sad sound\r\nmade Spot gloomier than ever.', '"Well," he muttered, "there\'s nothing\r\nelse to do, so I\'ll go and dig up that bone\r\nthat I buried in the orchard last week."', 'He found the bone where he had hidden\r\nit. Yet it did not look half as inviting\r\nas it had when he covered it with dirt\r\na few days before. He stared at it dully.\r\nThen he put it back in its hole and pawed\r\nthe dirt over it again.', "He found no pleasure in anything. No\r\nlonger was there any fun in chasing\r\nwoodchucks. The cows might have stayed\r\nin the cornfield all day long and Spot\r\nwouldn't have bothered them. He didn't\r\neven get any sport out of teasing Miss\r\nKitty Cat.", "Strangest of all, he couldn't find any\r\ncomfort in lying down for a quiet nap.\r\nThe moment he tried to pass the time\r\naway in that fashion he began to think\r\nabout Johnnie Green and what a nice boy\r\nhe was. And then he would get up and\r\nwalk around and around the house.\r\nHour after hour Spot spent in that\r\nfashion.", 'It wasn\'t many days before he had worn\r\na path in the grass all the way around the\r\nfarmhouse. When Farmer Green noticed\r\nit he didn\'t scold Spot. He patted his\r\nhead and said, "Cheer up, old boy!\r\nJohnnie\'ll be back one of these days."', 'Old dog Spot wagged his tail feebly.\r\nBut it was hard to wait.', '"It wouldn\'t be so bad," he said to himself,\r\n"if there was only somebody to play\r\nwith. If there was a puppy here on the\r\nfarm I\'d have some one that would be\r\nready to romp whenever I felt like it.\r\nAnd then Johnnie could go away visiting\r\nevery summer and I wouldn\'t miss him\r\nhalf as much."', "Spot forgot that a puppy wouldn't stay\r\na puppy forever.", "Johnnie Green came home from his visit\r\nat last. The moment Spot heard the old\r\nhorse Ebenezer come jogging up the road\r\nhe tore out of the yard and ran, barking,\r\nto meet the travellers. He frisked about\r\nthe buggy, he sprang up and touched\r\nEbenezer's nose with his own, he tried to\r\njump into the buggy beside Johnnie\r\nGreen.", 'Spot made such a racket that everybody\r\nin the farmhouse knew that Johnnie\r\nhad returned. The family were just sitting\r\ndown for dinner. And they all hurried\r\nout into the yard. For old dog Spot\r\nwas not the only one that had missed\r\nJohnnie while he was away on his visit.', 'Johnnie leaped out of the buggy, to be\r\nmet by a smother of pawings and nosings\r\nfrom old Spot.', '"Now, Spot—you behave!" said Johnnie\r\nGreen. "I\'m hungry and I want to\r\nget my dinner."', 'Spot paid not the slightest heed to his\r\nyoung master\'s objections. "You\'ll\r\nnever know how I\'ve missed you," he\r\nbarked. "And if I want to romp with\r\nyou for a few minutes, I\'m going to; and\r\nnobody can stop me."', 'After a little Spot grew a bit calmer.\r\nHe let Johnnie Green turn to the buggy\r\nand lift out a covered basket.', 'Spot promptly stuck his nose against it.\r\nThen he drew back quickly.', '"Wow!" he exclaimed. "This basket\r\nsmells doggy!"', 'Spot followed Johnnie into the house.\r\nAnd in the woodshed Johnnie opened the\r\nbasket and brought out of it a soft, silky,\r\nblinking—puppy!', '"Wow!" said Spot again. "It was no\r\nwonder that I noticed a doggy smell\r\nabout that basket." And then he said,\r\n"G-r-r-r!"', "Yes! Spot actually growled at the little\r\nnewcomer. For the moment he forgot\r\nthat he had been wishing, for days, that\r\nthere was a puppy about the place. To\r\ntell the truth, he couldn't help feeling the\r\nleast bit jealous of Johnnie Green's new\r\npet.", 'In a day or two, however, old Spot liked\r\nthe puppy as much as anybody else did.\r\nHe proved to be a playful little chap.\r\nAnd the older he grew the more fun-loving\r\nhe became.', "There were no more dull days for old\r\ndog Spot. When school opened in the fall\r\nhe no longer moped around the farmhouse,\r\nwaiting for Johnnie to come home.\r\nThe puppy kept him too busy to notice\r\nJohnnie's absence.", "At first Spot found it very pleasant to\r\nroll on the ground with his small friend,\r\nand pretend to bite him, and upset him\r\noff his somewhat wobbly legs. But as\r\ntime passed Spot began to weary of never-ending\r\nplay. There were moments when Spot wanted to lie\r\nstill and doze. But as soon as he had settled himself\r\nfor a nap the puppy was sure to come bouncing up\r\nand sprawl all over him. He would\r\nseize one of Spot's long ears between his\r\nteeth and give it a bit of a nip. Sometimes\r\nhe would even pull Spot's tail.", "Of course nobody can sleep under such\r\ninterruptions. Spot learned that when\r\nhe wanted to rest he had to hide in some\r\nplace where the puppy couldn't follow\r\nhim. And as the puppy became bigger\r\nSpot found it harder to slip away from\r\nhim. The youngster would trail Spot\r\ninto the barn and even as far as the hay-stack\r\nin the meadow.", 'Once the old dog had wished for a\r\npuppy. Now, however, he could scarcely\r\nwait for this lively youngster to grow into\r\na dog.', 'A whole year passed before Spot had\r\nany peace again. And when another\r\nsummer had come, and Johnnie Green\r\nwent visiting again, Spot muttered with a\r\ndeep groan:', '"I hope Johnnie will have sense enough\r\nnot to bring another puppy with him when\r\nhe comes home."', 'Mrs. Woodchuck was on her way home,\r\nwaddling across the pasture. She had\r\nbeen making a call on Aunt Polly Woodchuck,\r\nthe herb doctor, who lived under\r\nthe hill. They had talked over all the\r\nnews in the neighborhood. And Mrs.\r\nWoodchuck had her mind on some gossip\r\nthat Aunt Polly had told her. Otherwise\r\nshe might have noticed sooner that old dog\r\nSpot had spied her.', "If he hadn't spoken he would certainly\r\nhave caught her that time. For Mrs.\r\nWoodchuck was fat and couldn't run as\r\nfast as she used to. But when Spot's\r\nkeen nose caught a scent that told him\r\nthere was one of the Woodchuck family\r\nnot far away he just had to give one long-drawn\r\nhowl.", 'When Mrs. Woodchuck heard that\r\ndreadful sound she scurried for home.\r\nShe dropped her knitting and the apple\r\nthat Aunt Polly had given her. And she\r\nonly managed to pop down the hole that\r\nwas her front door with Spot scarcely a\r\nlength behind her.', '"Just missed her!" the old dog yelped.\r\n"How unlucky!"', '"Just escaped!" Mrs. Woodchuck\r\ngasped. "How fortunate!"', 'She knew that she was safe. So she\r\ntook her own time in crawling through the\r\nlong hall that led to her one-room dwelling.', '"Dear me!" she exclaimed as she entered\r\nher underground home and saw that\r\nit was empty. "Mr. Woodchuck and\r\nBilly are away. I must hurry and warn\r\nthem that old dog Spot is prowling about\r\nthe pasture."', "Meanwhile Spot lingered at Mrs. Woodchuck's\r\nfront door. He scratched in the\r\ndirt that was thrown up before it. He\r\nsniffed at the tracks that the Woodchuck\r\nfamily had made all about.", '"I know now where that fat Mrs. Woodchuck\r\nlives," he growled. "I\'ll keep an\r\neye on this hole. Some day I may be able\r\nto get between her and her home. And\r\nthen—"', 'He did not finish what he was saying,\r\nbut licked his lips as if he had just enjoyed\r\na hearty meal.', 'For a long time Spot waited there. He\r\ncould hardly have expected Mrs. Woodchuck\r\nto come out and invite him to enter\r\nher house. The most that she was likely\r\nto do would be to creep not quite to the\r\nupper end of her front hall and peer out to\r\nsee what she could through the small\r\nround opening.', '"That dame must have a family," Spot\r\nthought. "I\'d like to meet them—whether\r\nthere\'s one youngster or seven.\r\nThe more the merrier for me."', "If Spot had happened to look around\r\njust then he would have had his wish\r\ngranted. Or if the wind had been blowing\r\nthe other way he could have told, without\r\nlooking around, that Mrs. Woodchuck's\r\nson Billy was gazing at him, with\r\npopeyes, from behind a near-by hummock.\r\nHe had meandered homewards, pausing\r\nhere and there to nip off a clover head or\r\ntear at a plantain leaf, little dreaming\r\nthat old dog Spot was right in his door-yard.", 'When he caught sight of the unwelcome\r\ncaller Billy sat up and took one good, long\r\nlook at him.', "Then Mrs Woodchuck's son turned and\r\nran down the hillside as fast as his short\r\nlegs would carry him. He didn't stop until\r\nhe had reached the fence between the\r\npasture and the meadow. Dashing in\r\namong the brakes that grew deep along\r\nthe fence he cowered under the cover that\r\nthey gave him.", 'All at once he felt quite ashamed of\r\nhimself.', '"I almost forgot the rule!" he chattered.\r\n"The rule says, \'When there\'s a\r\nDog about, warn everybody!\'"', 'Billy Woodchuck remembered, after he\r\nhad fled from old dog Spot, that he ought\r\nto warn his family and his friends. So he\r\nsat up, stuck his head out of the tangle of\r\nbrakes where he had hidden, and gave the\r\ndanger signal, a sharp whistle.', '"Dear me!" he said. "I fear Father\r\nand Mother won\'t hear that. And if they\r\ngo home they\'ll run upon old dog Spot.\r\nAnd then there\'s no knowing what might\r\nhappen."', "He knew that his mother had gone to\r\nsee Aunt Polly Woodchuck, who lived under\r\nthe hill. And he knew that his father,\r\nwith a few cronies, was enjoying a feast\r\nin Farmer Green's clover patch.", '"I\'ll hurry over to Aunt Polly\'s first,"\r\nhe decided, "and tell Mother to beware\r\nthe Dog."', "So Billy Woodchuck scampered off toward\r\nthe hill where Aunt Polly Woodchuck\r\nmade her home. When he knocked\r\nat Aunt Polly's door and learned that\r\nMrs. Woodchuck had left some time before\r\nBilly was much upset.", '"Perhaps she went to the clover patch,"\r\nAunt Polly suggested. "You know your\r\nfather sometimes forgets to go home unless\r\nsomebody goes for him."', "Well, Billy started off again. And he\r\nhadn't gone far when he heard a sound\r\nthat made him sit up and listen. Like all\r\nhis family, he had very sharp ears. And\r\nnow, after cocking his head on one side\r\nfor a few moments, he knew that what he\r\nheard was old dog Spot grumbling and\r\ngrowling.", '"My goodness!" Billy Woodchuck\r\ngasped. "He\'s left our house. And if I\r\ndon\'t look out he\'ll catch me."', 'At almost the same instant old Spot\r\npaused and sniffed the air.', '"Ha!" he cried. "I smell a Woodchuck.\r\nAnd if I\'m not mistaken it\'s a\r\ndifferent Woodchuck from the one I\r\nchased a little while ago."', 'Billy Woodchuck and Spot began to\r\nrun at the same time. Billy headed for\r\nhome; and Spot headed for him.', 'Again old dog Spot was just a bit too\r\nlate. Billy Woodchuck darted into the\r\nhole in the hillside not a second too soon.\r\nHe could hear Spot panting close behind\r\nhim.', '"Such luck!" Spot growled. "There\'s\r\nanother that\'s got away from me.\r\nThere\'s the second one that I\'ve run into\r\nthat hole. I suppose they\'re chuckling\r\ninside their house and making all manner\r\nof fun of me."', 'The old dog was mistaken. Billy\r\nWoodchuck was not chuckling. He\r\nfound nobody at home. It was plain that\r\nhis parents were still abroad.', '"They may be coming from the clover\r\npatch now," he groaned. And if they\r\nare, they\'re sure to stumble upon that terrible\r\ncreature at the door. I must warn\r\nthem before it\'s too late."', "While Spot was still snorting and snuffling\r\naround the Woodchuck family's\r\nfront door, Billy Woodchuck crept out\r\nof the back door and started for the clover\r\npatch. Little did he know that his\r\nmother had already stolen out the same\r\nway, to warn him and his father.", 'When unwelcome callers come, a back\r\ndoor is sometimes a convenient thing to\r\nhave about a house.', "Old dog Spot never once guessed that\r\nthere was a back door to the Woodchuck\r\nfamily's home in the pasture. He had\r\nchased Mrs. Woodchuck into her house.\r\nHe had likewise hunted her son Billy into\r\nthe same front door through which his\r\nmother had scrambled only a short time\r\nbefore.", '"There must be more of these fat folks\r\nabout the pasture," Spot thought. "I\'ll\r\nrange around a bit and see if I can\'t surprise\r\nanother."', 'So he began running about the pasture\r\nin big circles. And he was lucky enough,\r\nbefore long, to come upon Mr. Woodchuck\r\nhimself, who had dined so heartily\r\non clover heads that he had decided to go\r\nto his chamber and take a nap.', 'Spot was unlucky enough to lose him.\r\nMr. Woodchuck had been feeling quite\r\nsleepy. But when he suddenly found\r\nhimself pursued by a dog he was wide\r\nawake in an instant and running like a\r\nyoungster.', 'He reached his home just in time.', '"Well, that makes the third one that\'s\r\ninside the house," Spot muttered, shortly\r\nafterward, as he paused to get his breath.', "Little did he know how mistaken he\r\nwas. There wasn't even one of the Woodchuck\r\nfamily at home; for Mr. Woodchuck\r\nhad at once hurried out the back\r\nway, because he wanted to find his wife\r\nand his son and tell them to keep away\r\nfrom old dog Spot.", 'Soon Spot took a few more turns\r\naround the pasture. And this time he\r\nran across Mrs. Woodchuck again.', 'He had no sooner run her to earth once\r\nmore than he found Billy for the second\r\ntime.', '"This is a twin brother of the fellow I\r\nchased home once before," Spot panted,\r\nlittle dreaming that Billy Woodchuck had\r\ncome back into the daylight.', '"This twin is just as spry as the other\r\none was," Spot gasped as he reached for\r\nBilly right at his door—and missed him.', "After that the old dog chased Mr.\r\nWoodchuck, then his wife, and next their\r\nson Billy Woodchuck. And he didn't\r\nsucceed in catching any one of the three.\r\nEach of them beat him in the race to the\r\nWoodchuck family's front door.", 'Old Spot began to feel quite upset.', '"I don\'t see what the matter with me to-day,"\r\nhe puzzled. "I hope I\'m not getting\r\nso old that I\'m weeble." (By that\r\nhe meant weak and feeble.)', '"This last one makes eight that I\'ve followed\r\nall the way to this door," Spot\r\ngrowled. "There can\'t be many more\r\nleft in the pasture. I\'m going to lie down\r\nbehind this hummock and wait till they\r\ncome out."', 'So he hid a little way off and watched\r\nclosely.', 'He had been there a long time when Mr.\r\nCrow at last flew low over the pasture and\r\nalighted in a tree near-by.', '"What are you waiting for?" he asked\r\nSpot.', '"Woodchucks!" said Spot. "This\r\nburrow is full of them."', '"Are you sure?" Mr. Crow inquired.', '"I chased eight of them home," Spot\r\nexplained.', '"That\'s odd," said Mr. Crow. "There\r\nhave been only three living here lately.\r\nAnd they don\'t live here any more."', '"They don\'t!" Spot cried.', '"No!" Mr. Crow told him. "They\r\nmoved this afternoon."', 'Old dog Spot sprang to his feet.', '"Where did they go?" he demanded.', '"Ah!" Mr. Crow croaked. "That\'s\r\ntelling." And he would say no more.', 'Then Spot went back to the farmyard.', "Meanwhile the Woodchuck family were\r\nworking hard, digging a new home for\r\nthemselves at the other end of the pasture.\r\nThey had all met at last on the edge of the\r\nclover patch. And Mr. Woodchuck had\r\ndeclared that they must move at once, because\r\nit wasn't safe to live in their old\r\nhouse any longer. He said that old dog\r\nSpot would be sure to keep an eye on it\r\nfor some time.", 'They soon found a place that suited\r\nthem all very well.', '"We\'ll live here," said Mr. Woodchuck\r\nto his wife and their son Billy.\r\n"You two can take turns digging while\r\nI sit up and watch for old dog Spot.\r\nAfter all the running I did to-day it\r\nwouldn\'t be safe for me to do any digging."', "That was Mr. Woodchuck's plan. And\r\nthey followed it.", "Great circus posters had covered one side\r\nof Farmer Green's barn for weeks. Ever\r\nsince some men came and pasted them on\r\nthe barn Johnnie Green had studied them\r\ncarefully. He had practiced bareback\r\nriding on his pony, Twinkleheels. He\r\nhad tried a high dive into the mill pond\r\nfrom the top of the dam. And much to\r\nold dog Spot's disgust Johnnie had tried\r\nto make him jump through a hoop covered\r\nwith paper.", 'Spot had refused flatly to do anything\r\nof the kind. If he had known that his\r\nyoung master had half a notion to teach\r\nhim to jump through a hoop of fire Spot\r\nwould have run away—at least until circus\r\ntime had come and gone.', '"What puts all these queer ideas into\r\nJohnnie\'s head?" the old dog asked his\r\nfriend Ebenezer, the horse, one day.', '"Don\'t you know?" said Ebenezer.\r\n"It\'s those circus pictures. Johnnie\r\nwon\'t think of anything else until the\r\ntwenty-third of August."', '"What\'s going to happen then?" Spot\r\ninquired.', '"That\'s the day when the circus comes\r\nto the village," the old horse explained.\r\n"The whole family\'s going to see it."', '"Do you expect to take them?"', '"No!" Ebenezer replied. "Farmer\r\nGreen will hitch the bays to the carryall.\r\nAnd to tell the truth, I\'ll be just as pleased\r\nto stay behind. It will be a great day to\r\ntake naps here at home."', '"It will be a lonesome day, with everybody\r\naway," said Spot. "I believe I\'ll\r\ngo to the circus myself."', '"Farmer Green may decide to leave you\r\nhere," the old horse suggested.', '"Then I\'ll surprise him," said Spot.\r\n"I\'ll hide behind a tree until Farmer\r\nGreen has driven out of the yard. And\r\nthen I\'ll follow the carryall."', "The old dog began to tell everybody in\r\nthe farmyard that he was going to the circus\r\non the twenty-third of August. Of\r\ncourse some of the farmyard folk were\r\njealous of him. The Rooster remarked\r\nthat he didn't believe Spot would hear any\r\ncrowing at the circus that would be worth\r\nlistening to. Turkey Proudfoot said that\r\nwhen it came to strutting the circus\r\ncouldn't show Spot any that couldn't be\r\nbeaten right there on the farm. And\r\nHenrietta Hen, who went to the county\r\nfair the year before, declared that she\r\nshouldn't care to go to the village except\r\nto see a poultry show.", "But old dog Spot didn't mind anything\r\nthey said. And when the twenty-third of\r\nAugust came he lingered about the farmyard.\r\nEarly in the morning he saw\r\nFarmer Green run the carryall into the\r\nyard and harness the bays to it. Then\r\nthe rest of the family came out of the\r\nhouse.", 'Spot, from his hiding place behind a\r\ntree, was pleased to see that Johnnie\r\nGreen did not forget to bring a big lunch\r\nbasket with him.', "At last everybody was ready to start.\r\nAnd then, to Spot's dismay, Farmer\r\nGreen caught sight of his nose, sticking\r\nout from behind a tree.", '"That dog means to follow us," he\r\ncried. "I\'ll have to shut him up in the\r\nbarn." And to old Spot he called, "Come\r\nhere, sir!"', "Spot didn't dare disobey. With his\r\ntail between his legs he crept up to the\r\ncarryall. And though he whined and\r\nbegged to be taken to the circus, Farmer\r\nGreen caught hold of his collar and led\r\nhim into the barn. Then Farmer Green\r\nclosed the door.", 'Poor Spot had to give one loud howl\r\nwhen he heard the wheels of the carryall\r\ncrunching on the gravel driveway.', "The bays had to step lively that morning,\r\nfor Farmer Green's family didn't\r\nwant to be late for the circus parade in\r\nthe village.", "There were many other teams on the\r\nroad, and almost nobody to be seen working\r\nin the fields. It seemed to Johnnie\r\nGreen as if everybody had made up his\r\nmind to go to the circus. The only thing\r\nthat troubled him was that his father\r\ndidn't drive fast enough to suit him.", 'Half way from the farm to the village\r\nFarmer Green stopped the bays at a watering\r\ntrough. Johnnie jumped out of\r\nthe carryall to uncheck them, so they\r\ncould drink. And there, beneath the carriage,\r\nwas old dog Spot!', '"Spot\'s followed us!" Johnnie Green\r\ncried.', "The old dog whisked out from between\r\nthe wheels and frolicked about Johnnie.\r\nHe didn't act at all guilty.", '"Well, I never!" said Farmer Green.\r\n"I certainly shut the barn door after I\r\nshoved him inside."', 'Spot gave a few short, sharp barks, as\r\nif to say, "Yes! But you forgot the window\r\nthat was open."', 'He had scrambled through the window\r\nand overtaken the carryall before it\r\nreached the gristmill.', 'Well, what could Farmer Green do?\r\nThey had come too far to send Spot back\r\nhome.', '"We\'ll have to take him with us now,"\r\nsaid Johnnie Green\'s father, "though\r\nhe\'ll be a nuisance because the village will\r\nbe crowded to-day."', "As soon as the bays had had their drink\r\nthe party started on again. And old dog\r\nSpot was content. He did not mind the\r\ndust that the bays' heels kicked up as he\r\nfollowed beneath the carriage. And the\r\nfaster they trotted, the more they pleased\r\nhim; for he was as anxious as Johnnie\r\nGreen to get to town and see the crowds\r\nand the fun.", 'Once a surly dog ran out from a farmhouse\r\nand tried to reach him. That made\r\nSpot somewhat uneasy.', '"I don\'t want to stop to fight this fellow,"\r\nhe thought. "If I do, I\'ll be left\r\nbehind."', 'Luckily Farmer Green cut at the\r\nstrange dog with his whip and bade him\r\nbe off.', 'Spot grinned as he sneaked away, yelping.', "At last they entered the village. Main\r\nStreet was thronged with people. Carriages\r\nand wagons of all sorts lined the\r\nroad on both sides—glistening buggies\r\nwith red ribbons tied in bows about the\r\nwhip stocks, old lumber wagons with\r\nchairs set behind the driver's seat.", 'Johnnie Green had never seen such a\r\ngathering—not even at the fair.', '"The whole county\'s here!" he exclaimed.\r\n"I hope we\'ll find a good place\r\nto stop, where we can see the parade."', 'They did. Farmer Green backed the\r\nbays into the last open space in the gutter.\r\nAnd Johnnie Green was greatly relieved.', 'The crowd made such a roar, with its\r\ntalking and laughter, that old Spot cowered\r\ndown under the carryall and almost\r\nwished he had stayed at home. The cries\r\nof men selling peanuts and popcorn,\r\nsquawkers and toy balloons, mingled with\r\nthe shouts of small boys and the squeals\r\nof their sisters.', '"Goodness!" Spot murmured. "What\r\na racket! It hurts my ears."', 'A moment later he stuck his nose out\r\nfrom beneath the carriage and burst into\r\na mournful howl.', '"Keep still!" Farmer Green ordered.', "Little did he know, then, what made\r\nSpot cry like that. But in a minute or\r\ntwo Johnnie Green heard the same thing\r\nthat Spot's sharp ears had caught first.\r\nAnd Johnnie howled too.", '"Hear the band!" he shouted. "Hurrah!\r\nThe parade\'s coming!"', 'The crash and blare of the circus band\r\ncame nearer and nearer. Johnnie Green\r\ncraned his neck out of the carryall, as it\r\nstood at the side of Main Street, and tried\r\nto get a glimpse of the parade.', 'Old dog Spot did not howl again, but\r\nstole out beside the bays and looked up\r\nthe street too.', 'Soon a man with a tall, shiny hat on\r\nhis head rode a proud, prancing horse\r\naround a corner. And behind him six\r\nmore horses with gay plumes on their\r\nbridles made a wide turn as they swung\r\ninto view. On top of the high red wagon\r\nthat they drew sat the band, all in red\r\nsuits and playing away like mad.', "Spot couldn't help whining. Although\r\nthe bandsmen were playing the liveliest\r\nair they knew, music always made Spot\r\nsad. And he was glad when the band\r\nwagon had passed on.", 'Other wagons, blazoned with red and\r\ngold, followed.', "Old dog Spot's hair began to rise along\r\nhis back and he sniffed, growling. He\r\nhad noticed a strange mixture of the\r\nqueerest odors. He didn't know, for a\r\nmoment, whether to run away or not.", '"Oh, see the tiger!" Johnnie Green\r\nshouted. "And the lions! And the monkeys!\r\nAnd the bear!"', '"See them!" Spot yelped. "I say,\r\nsmell them!"', 'He felt better when the animals in their\r\ncages had gone creaking past. And he\r\nforgot his uneasiness as he watched dozens\r\nof horses, ridden by folk whose bespangled\r\nclothes glittered in the sunlight.', "Then came a funny man in a little, two-wheeled\r\ncart, driving a donkey. This\r\nwas the clown. He bowed and smiled to\r\neverybody, right and left, and even threw\r\nkisses at some of the girls. His painted\r\nface, his bag-like clothes, and his odd little\r\nround, pointed hat made Johnnie\r\nGreen laugh. And to Johnnie's great delight,\r\nwhen the clown saw Spot he whistled.", "Old Spot was all for dashing out into\r\nthe street. But Farmer Green wouldn't\r\nlet him do that. Spot had to be content\r\nwith barking at the clown.", 'Then a man on a brisk little horse came\r\ndown the street. He had a big voice.\r\nAnd he kept using it all the time, shouting\r\nso everybody would be sure to hear, "Look\r\nout for your bosses! The elephants are\r\ncoming!"', 'And they came. The elephants came.\r\nWhen Spot saw their huge forms plodding\r\ndown Main Street he dived beneath\r\nthe carryall again and shivered until the\r\nlast one had passed along.', 'The bays stirred restlessly as the elephants\r\nneared them. And the younger of\r\nthe pair snorted with fear.', "Farmer Green talked to them in a soothing\r\nvoice and told them there wasn't any\r\ndanger. But nobody thought of talking\r\nto old dog Spot. Every one forgot about\r\nhim. And he was just as badly frightened\r\nas the bays, especially when a terrible\r\ntooting and screeching burst forth.", 'Spot jumped almost out of his skin.', '"Sakes alive!" he howled. "What awful\r\nvoices the elephants have!"', '"The steam calliope!" Johnnie Green\r\ncried. "And that\'s the end of the parade."', "The Green family ate their luncheon in\r\nthe carryall on Main Street, after the circus\r\nparade had passed. They didn't forget\r\nto give old dog Spot something to eat\r\nout of the big basket that they had\r\nbrought with them from home. Although\r\nthey hadn't expected him to go to the village\r\nwith them, there was more than\r\nenough food for everybody. Even Johnnie\r\nGreen's appetite wasn't equal to all\r\nthe goodies that his mother had provided.", 'People were already starting for the\r\ncircus grounds on the outskirts of the village.\r\nJohnnie Green noticed them uneasily.', '"We don\'t want to be late for the\r\nshow," he reminded his father.', '"We\'ll get there in time," Farmer\r\nGreen assured him.', 'And they did. Soon they followed the\r\ncrowd through the village streets until\r\nthey came in sight of the "big top," the\r\ngreat tent with flags flying above it, and\r\nsmaller tents all around.', "Farmer Green turned the bays into a\r\nyard near-by, where he unharnessed and\r\nfed them. Then he tied one end of a rope\r\nto Spot's collar and fastened the other end\r\nto a carriage wheel.", '"There!" he said. "Now we\'re\r\nready."', "Old dog Spot didn't want to be left behind.\r\nHe tugged at the rope and whined.", '"Be quiet!" Johnnie Green\'s father\r\nsaid to him. "You followed us to the\r\nvillage. And now you\'ll have to behave\r\nyourself. They wouldn\'t let you into the\r\nshow."', 'Then the Green family turned their\r\nbacks on him.', '"They needn\'t think they can keep me\r\nhere," Spot growled. "I didn\'t run all\r\nthe way from the farm to the village to be\r\ntied to a wagon wheel."', "Johnnie Green and his father and\r\nmother hadn't been gone a quarter of an\r\nhour when Spot succeeded in slipping his\r\ncollar over his head. Then he dashed out\r\nof the yard and ran to the circus grounds\r\nas fast as he could go.", 'Spot mingled with the crowds of people\r\nthat were pouring into the big tent. He\r\nworked his way in and out among the\r\nthrong, all but tripping many of the pleasure\r\nseekers.', "Though he looked everywhere, he\r\ncouldn't find the Green family. They\r\nhad already passed through the entrance\r\nand were enjoying the sights inside the\r\ncanvas.", 'At last Spot met a man—a circus man—who\r\nwas very friendly. It was pleasant\r\nto get a kind word from somebody, after\r\nso many people had told him to "get out,"\r\nand had given him a shove.', 'This kindly person called Spot into a\r\nlow tent and patted him. He gave Spot\r\na bit of meat and even thought to offer\r\nhim a drink of water.', '"This is a fine pointer," the man remarked\r\nto a friend of his who was with\r\nhim. "He hasn\'t any collar; so he must\r\nbe anybody\'s dog. And he might as well\r\nbe mine."', "Spot wagged his tail. He didn't quite\r\nunderstand what his new acquaintance\r\nwas saying. But it seemed to be something\r\nnice.", "And then Spot decided, suddenly, that\r\nhe had stayed in that tent long enough.\r\nFor the pleasant man found a piece of\r\nrope and tried to tie it about Spot's neck.", '"I\'ve been tied up once to-day; and once\r\nis enough," Spot growled. Slipping out\r\nof the man\'s grasp, Spot ran out of doors.', 'Both men followed him. For a few\r\nminutes they chased him. One of them\r\ntripped over a guy rope and sprawled on\r\nthe ground. And to escape the other\r\nSpot dodged under a canvas wall where it\r\nlifted slightly at the bottom.', 'He found himself in a huge tent where\r\nhundreds of people sat all around on tiers\r\nof seats. Men and horses were capering\r\nabout in the center of the place. And\r\nsomewhere a band was playing.', 'He was under the big top.', "Old dog Spot was bewildered. When he\r\ncrawled under the canvas he had not\r\ndreamed that he was entering the main\r\ntent of the circus. He saw so many\r\nstrange sights that he didn't know\r\nwhether to bark or to crawl away and hide\r\nsomewhere. Yet among all those people\r\nhe felt lonely. He couldn't see anybody\r\nhe knew.", 'All at once the bandsmen began to play\r\nlouder than ever. They seemed to be trying\r\nto burst their horns—or themselves.\r\nAnd men in flowing robes, each one standing\r\nin a sort of little two-wheeled cart and\r\ndriving four horses abreast, came tearing\r\npast the place where Spot was standing.', 'It was a race! And if there was one\r\nthing that Spot liked more than another\r\nit was a race of any kind. He gave a few\r\ndelighted barks and ran after the galloping\r\nhorses.', 'Spot followed them twice around the\r\nbig tent. And just as he fell into a jog—for\r\nthe race was finished—he heard a\r\nwhistle that gave him a great thrill. He\r\nstood still for an instant. Then he dashed\r\ntoward the nearest seats.', 'A moment later he was fawning upon\r\nJohnnie Green, who sat in the lowest row\r\nand seemed as glad to see Spot as Spot\r\nwas to see him.', "Lying between Johnnie's feet, Spot\r\nwatched the rest of the show.", 'At last the circus was over. The Green\r\nfamily, with Spot at their heels, went back\r\nto the place where they had left the bays\r\nand the carryall. And in a few minutes\r\nmore they were on their way back to\r\nPleasant Valley and home.', 'That morning everybody on the road\r\nhad seemed to be in a great hurry to get\r\nto the village. And now, late in the afternoon,\r\neverybody was in just as great a\r\nhurry to get away from it. Farmer\r\nGreen kept the bays at a spanking trot,\r\nonly pausing to let them breathe now and\r\nthen on the hills.', "Spot, however, was not in such haste\r\nthat he didn't stop and give a good trouncing\r\nto the dog that had rushed out at him\r\nearlier in the day. Spot sent the surly\r\nfellow yelping into his master's yard.\r\nThen he rushed down the road to overtake\r\nthe carryall.", "But, to everybody's surprise, when they\r\nreached home old dog Spot was missing.", '"He\'ll come back," Farmer Green said.\r\n"Probably he\'s stopped somewhere to\r\nchase a rabbit or something. He\'ll be\r\nalong after a while."', 'But after the cows were milked old Spot\r\nwas still absent. And after the family\r\nhad eaten supper he had failed to appear.\r\nBedtime came. Still no Spot!', 'Johnnie Green felt very sad when he\r\nwent upstairs.', 'He felt even worse when morning came.\r\nHe had hoped that Spot would be in the\r\nyard, begging for his breakfast.', 'Johnnie Green was able to eat only a\r\nlittle of his own breakfast. And as soon\r\nas he left the table he went to the barn and\r\nharnessed his pony, Twinkleheels, to the\r\nlittle buggy with the red wheels.', 'Then Johnnie started for the village.', 'Johnnie Green drove his pony, Twinkleheels,\r\nback over the road that led to the\r\nvillage. Now and then he stopped at a\r\nfarmhouse to inquire whether anybody\r\nhad seen old dog Spot, who had vanished\r\non the way home from the circus the evening\r\nbefore.', 'Nobody had set eyes on him. And\r\nJohnnie Green drove on and on, feeling\r\nmore and more miserable all the while.', "At last, as he turned a sharp bend of\r\nthe road, he heard a bark. There was no\r\nmistaking it. It was Spot's.", 'There was a joyful meeting then.\r\nJohnnie sprang out of the buggy and Spot\r\nsprang into his arms. And Johnnie\r\nhugged the old fellow tightly, right there\r\nin the middle of the road.', '"What in the world has kept you here\r\never since yesterday?" Johnnie asked.', 'Spot must have understood. Anyhow,\r\nhe dashed to one side of the road. And,\r\nfollowing him, Johnnie found there a robe\r\nthat belonged to his father. It had\r\ndropped out of the carryall the evening\r\nbefore, when the Green family were on\r\ntheir way home from seeing the circus.\r\nNobody in the carriage had missed it.\r\nBut old Spot, running under the carriage,\r\nhad seen it fall. And he had stayed behind\r\nto guard it all through the long\r\nnight.', "Of course Spot couldn't tell Johnnie\r\nGreen all this. But Johnnie wasn't slow\r\nin guessing what had happened.", "He picked up the robe and put it under\r\nthe seat of the little buggy. Then he and\r\nSpot both jumped in. And Johnnie\r\nturned Twinkleheels' head toward home.", 'Back at the farm almost everybody said\r\nthat old dog Spot was a hero. Farmer\r\nGreen exclaimed that Spot was a faithful\r\nold fellow. And Mrs. Green set out such\r\na meal for him as Spot had never seen\r\nbefore in all his life.', "Now, there were two or three of Spot's\r\nneighbors in the farmyard that didn't like\r\nthe praise he was getting. Turkey Proudfoot,\r\nthe gobbler, remarked that if people\r\ndidn't know enough to come home to roost\r\nat night he saw no reason for making a\r\nfuss about it. Miss Kitty Cat declared\r\nthat so far as she was concerned she would\r\nhave been just as well pleased if Spot\r\nhadn't come back to the farm at all. And\r\nHenrietta Hen had more to say than anyone\r\nelse. She hurried up to old dog Spot\r\nhimself and insisted on talking with him.", '"Huh!" she exclaimed. "You only\r\nspent one day at the circus, while last fall\r\nI stayed a whole week at the county fair."', '"Did you hear a band at the fair?" Spot\r\nasked her.', '"Yes!"', '"Did you see any races?"', '"There were races every day; but I\r\ndidn\'t care to watch them," Henrietta\r\nHen answered.', '"Did you see any elephants at the\r\nfair?" Spot demanded.', '"Elephants?" said Henrietta Hen.\r\n"What are elephants?"', 'Spot pointed—with his nose—to one of\r\nthe posters on the barn.', '"There\'s a picture of some elephants,"\r\nhe told her. "And I must say it\'s a good\r\none."', '"There were no elephants at the county\r\nfair," Henrietta Hen admitted as she\r\ngazed at the circus poster on the side of\r\nthe barn. "Why, every one of them has\r\ntwo tails!" she cried. "I don\'t see how\r\nthey know whether they\'re going backward\r\nor forward."', '"Maybe they don\'t know," Spot retorted.\r\n"Maybe that\'s part of the fun in\r\nbeing an elephant. For I suppose there\'s\r\nfun of some sort in being anybody, even\r\na-a-a—"', '"Even a what?" Henrietta snapped.\r\n"Were you going to say a Hen?"', '"I was," Spot replied. "But I remembered\r\nthat it wouldn\'t be polite."', '"I should say not!" Henrietta Hen\r\ncackled. "I should say not!" And then,\r\nbeing very angry, she hurried off to tell\r\nthe rooster what had happened.', '"I\'ll have to be careful how I talk to\r\nthese farmyard folks," Spot muttered.\r\n"They haven\'t had a chance to learn some\r\nof the things that I know.', '"For I\'ve been to the village and seen\r\nthe world—and the circus, too," added old\r\ndog Spot.', "Transcriber's Notes:\r\nThe page numbers in the List of Illustrations do not reflect the new placement of the illustrations, but are as in the original.\r\nAll errors from the original book were kept and are noted below.\r\n"]
